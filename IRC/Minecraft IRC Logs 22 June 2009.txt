A12:14:33 <Maulrus> I could potentially leave it up til, say, 7 in the morning
A12:14:43 <Maulrus> but I don't really want to
A12:15:06 <Maulrus> eventually I'll get it into a setup where it's more or less on all the time
A12:15:36 <Maulrus> I am forced to jump to and from a variety of computers, so it won't be up constantly ever

A4:44:01 <mib_7ihq9l> could somebody please tell me WTF is up with the swastiaks? why are they on every server, and sometimes protected?
A4:44:57 <m0bus> laterz
A4:45:10 <m0bus> people love the white powers
A4:45:27 <m0bus> i think everyone in the world should be pretty desensitized to them by NOW
A4:45:30 <Quatroking> What's wrong with swastika's?
A4:45:37 <mib_7ihq9l> has the internet gotten +20 stupid without me noticing?!
A4:45:46 <mib_7ihq9l> is it just 12 year old kids running around these servers?
A4:45:51 <m0bus> they were pretty offensive like...60 years ago
A4:45:58 <m0bus> its MOSTLY 12 year olds
A4:45:58 <Quatroking> There's nothing wrong with a swastika, honestly.
A4:46:00 <mib_7ihq9l> what's the point, unless you're trying to piss people off?
A4:46:07 <m0bus> it works right?
A4:46:13 <mib_7ihq9l> yes, and that makes you a dick.
A4:46:17 <m0bus> :P
A4:46:20 <m0bus> i dont make them
A4:46:24 <Quatroking> Well it certainly pisses you off
A4:46:33 <m0bus> i just say that people will always find ways to piss off other people
A4:46:40 <m0bus> and it works
A4:46:51 <mib_7ihq9l> i understand griefing, but EVERY server? is it some meme I'm not aware of?
A4:47:05 <m0bus> i said it earlier
A4:47:09 <Ylle> Lots of people are jerks, they're just afraid irl.
A4:47:09 <m0bus> no matter what you do
A4:47:14 <m0bus> no matter who you are
A4:47:19 <m0bus> no matter where you live
A4:47:26 <Ylle> And hell, if you're going to see something written on the wall on a bathroom stall
A4:47:27 <m0bus> you will run into griefers in all walks of life
A4:47:31 <Ylle> its gon' be a swastika
A4:47:35 <m0bus> it could be a mailman or your boss
A4:47:36 <Ylle> or a failed swastika
A4:47:46 <Quatroking> I've even seen goddamn hammer and sickles :P
A4:47:47 <m0bus> you will always find griefers in this world
A4:47:52 <m0bus> just get used to it man
A4:48:03 <mib_7ihq9l> these aren't griefers. they're systematic griefers.
A4:48:03 <m0bus> dont let things irk you so much
A4:48:09 <m0bus> :P
A4:48:11 <m0bus> lol
A4:48:15 <mib_7ihq9l> the swastikas don't irk me, just the people whose sole purpose is to piss people off.
A4:48:23 <mib_7ihq9l> they can GTFO my internets, plz.
A4:48:33 <m0bus> well they might not get far in life, who knows
A4:48:46 <Quatroking> I like to troll around once in a while on Newgrounds, and that's just to piss people off and get hilarious comments back
A4:48:49 <m0bus> the internet was designed for griefers
A4:49:07 <m0bus> by a griefer
A4:49:18 <Quatroking> Once people understand I'm doing it for the comments, they mostly see the fun in the comments too
A4:49:49 <m0bus> :P
A4:50:04 <m0bus> the trolling griefer...classic
A4:50:10 <m0bus> bothers some people
A4:50:13 <m0bus> no big deal 
A4:50:26 <Quatroking> remembers me of a Hanky guy a few days ago
A4:50:26 <m0bus> i get a kick out of seeing someone grief
A4:50:29 <Quatroking> he came on the IRC
A4:50:44 <m0bus> griefer?
A4:50:47 <Quatroking> and he started thanking Notch because minecraft cured his braincancer
A4:50:52 <Quatroking> fucking hilarious

A5:11:08 <Quatroking> Yeah

A5:11:20 <Quatroking> the master list doesn't know which of the comptuers is sending the server signal you see
A5:11:30 <Quatroking> that's why we got port forwarding
A5:11:41 <Quatroking> so anyways, launch up that cmd.exe
A5:12:04 <Quatroking> got that open?
A5:12:10 <Turtleboats> yep
A5:12:25 <Quatroking> type this and hit enter:
A5:12:30 <Quatroking> ipconfig
A5:12:40 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:12:45 <Quatroking> it should throw out a bunch of stuff
A5:12:51 <Turtleboats> yepp
A5:13:06 <Quatroking> you see the ip adresses?
A5:13:18 <Turtleboats> yeah think so
A5:13:24 <Turtleboats> at the top of the list thing right?
A5:13:27 <Quatroking> the ones we need are your ipv4 adres/local ip and your gateway adress
A5:13:29 <Turtleboats> there are like 3
A5:13:30 <Quatroking> Yeah

A5:15:20 <Quatroking> does it ask for a password?
A5:15:35 <Turtleboats> umm
A5:15:36 <Turtleboats> i guess not

A5:15:45 <Turtleboats> it says password set

A5:20:17 <marach> can someone help in http://minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?id=378, it's really urgent...
A5:20:55 <Quatroking> marach, just wait a few days until the exchange goes up
A5:21:09 <Quatroking> it happens to me all the time, but with larger amounts like 50 euro's at a time :P
A5:21:27 <Quatroking> Turtleboats, did you got the router and usb adapter as a Wireless N Starter Kit?
A5:21:40 <Turtleboats> possibly
A5:21:45 <Turtleboats> i really don't know that one
A5:21:53 <Quatroking> Well Let's assume that then
A5:21:56 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:21:59 <Turtleboats> sounds like a plan
A5:22:09 <Quatroking> considering its the only way a DWA-140 can be acquired
A5:22:17 <Turtleboats> haha 
A5:22:19 <Quatroking> which would mean your router is.... a DIR-635
A5:22:31 <Quatroking> found it.
A5:22:56 <citricsquid> marach: I replied :)
A5:23:05 <Turtleboats> k
A5:23:19 <Quatroking> Turtleboats, take a look at this
A5:23:20 <Quatroking> http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Dlink/DIR-635/default.htm
A5:23:55 <Quatroking> That interface looks horrible compared to my router by the way, dear god
A5:24:22 <citricsquid> my router is hilarious, if you plug anything into the wall sockets in our house it goes offline =(
A5:24:28 <Turtleboats> which one is my router ip?
A5:24:38 <Quatroking> your gateway
A5:24:40 <Turtleboats> kk
A5:24:58 <Turtleboats> hold up
A5:25:10 <Turtleboats> it didn't take me to a dlink site
A5:25:14 <Turtleboats> it took me to at&t
A5:25:30 <Quatroking> but at&t is your internet provider..
A5:25:36 <Turtleboats> yeah
A5:25:50 <Turtleboats> the tutorial thing shows a dlink site coming up
A5:25:57 <Turtleboats> i never got to that site
A5:26:01 <Quatroking> It's possible they've thrown in a custom version in your router
A5:26:17 <Quatroking> you don't get any setup options either?
A5:26:48 <Turtleboats> dont think so
A5:27:21 <Quatroking> Well then I'm out of idea's, I've never seen the gateway Ip leading to your provider's website before
A5:27:22 <marach> i know a sitewhere you can get 0.10 $ for free in exchange of big amount of spam...
A5:27:35 <Quatroking> give it to me, marach
A5:27:37 <citricsquid> marach: Read the topic =D I'll send you the money you need :P
A5:27:57 <marach> ok big thx
A5:28:22 <marach> couldnt exchangerate go up insteadof down...
A5:28:41 <marach> failing spacebar
A5:28:42 <citricsquid> yep, but might take a while
A5:28:45 <Quatroking> it's idfferent all the time
A5:28:49 <citricsquid> it could potentially keep going down and down for a while
A5:28:55 <citricsquid> or it could go up for ages, it's magic!
A5:29:09 <Quatroking> When I bought my PC my money gone up and down by amounts like 50 euro's or something
A5:29:17 <Quatroking> because I had so much :P
A5:30:07 <marach> just a silly question, who here is NOT using mibbit? :)
A5:30:17 <citricsquid> mIRC =D

A6:08:35 <marach> whats this extension anyway?
A6:08:55 <Quatroking> it makes it possible to add raw HTMl to protected pages on the wiki
A6:09:05 <Alwayswatching> So what does everyone think the next update will be
A6:09:29 <Quatroking> which makes it possible to embed the Mibbit IRC client so that all the stupid people won't have to spam around on the forums about how they can't use IRC because they got brain tumors
A6:09:30 <marach> i have no ideahow this game can bebetter

A6:10:07 <Quatroking> slippy ice and bouncy rubber
A6:10:11 <marach> maybe a mode like in infiniminer?
A6:10:20 <Quatroking> citricsquid you can do that too

A7:34:33 <citricsquid> it's the way the server side client runs afaik
A7:34:39 <citricsquid> you need to use the local IP of your machine
A7:35:00 <Turtleboats> well how come nobody else can join either?
A7:35:04 <Turtleboats> and also
A7:35:13 <citricsquid> What's the server name?

A7:36:41 <citricsquid> is it sending heartbeats?
A7:37:08 <Turtleboats> it says level saved!
A7:37:18 <Turtleboats> load 0/16
A7:37:24 <Turtleboats> what are heartbeats?
A7:37:28 <citricsquid> okay, the problem is most likely your ports then.
A7:38:03 <Turtleboats> i already port forwarded
A7:38:42 <ZomBuster> anyone know fueuer
A7:38:45 <Turtleboats> Like the only way i can get on is by putting in the info manually. and Nobody else can get on from the link

A7:57:11 <Flyboy> Ok then. Ppl call me crazy things sometimes.
A7:57:22 <AlLnAtuRalX> His name ingame was WingBoy

A8:00:21 <ZomBuster> peerkoel
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> I never thought about it like that.
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> Also why do men have nipples?
A8:00:49 <Flyboy> Think about it>
A8:00:58 <citricsquid> we all start out as women
A8:01:11 <flak> we all start out as cell
A8:01:11 <citricsquid> and the best become men
A8:01:12 <citricsquid> ;)
A8:01:27 <flak> and then cell grows nipples
A8:01:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> No, we actually start out as two cells
A8:01:31 <citricsquid> "All humans begin life in the womb as females. If no Y chromosome is present in the foetus, then the embryo will continue to develop as and be born as a female. If there is a Y chromosome present in the embryo, the male sex hormone testosterone restricts the full development of breasts to just nipples,"
A8:01:49 <citricsquid> LOL
A8:01:54 <citricsquid> "So we know when it's time to put on a jumper. "
A8:01:55 <Flyboy> Yeah. When you think about it we were the fastest sperm out of 250,000,000
A8:02:15 <flak> or the strongest
A8:02:21 <Flyboy> Bit amazing isn't it.
A8:02:22 <flak> maybe they kill each other
A8:02:25 <citricsquid> I posted that on a forum, "When your parents hate you, remember that you beat millions of other sperm so it could have been worse"
A8:02:31 <Flyboy> That would be epic.
A8:02:46 <citricsquid> I wish we could remember being sperms, that'd be awesome.
A8:02:49 <Flyboy> SPERM COLLISEUM!!!!
A8:03:09 <flak> or maybe one sperm that lives is the smallest, so it can squeeze through when nobody can see it
A8:03:23 <Flyboy> That would explain a lot.
A8:03:56 <Flyboy> Anyone live in NZ?
A8:06:09 <smn> nazi zone?
A8:06:16 <smn> ooh
A8:06:20 <smn> i see now
A8:06:27 <smn> new zealand huh
A8:06:30 <citricsquid> naked nebras
A8:07:23 <Flyboy>     yeo
A8:07:23 <Flyboy> Yep.*
A8:08:04 <Flyboy> I was talking to someone on Omegle who had never heard of New Zealand.
A8:08:25 <AlLnAtuRalX> That's because most people on omegle are 4channers
A8:08:57 <Flyboy> They seemed preeeeeeeeeeety sincere.
A8:09:09 <Flyboy> But mebbe not.

P12:09:42 <JTE> Heh.
P12:10:11 <Boinciel> They'd be too ugly to use in normal construction, but you could hide them under floors and stuff
P12:10:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> rainbow sponges; you crazy
P12:10:26 <Boinciel> Yes, I am!
P12:10:33 <AnnihilatorBeta> then they wouldn't be cheesy anymore!

P12:11:45 <flak> glowing glass
P12:11:56 <flak> so it would cast light around
P12:12:01 <flak> and glow in the dark
P12:12:02 <flak> yeah
P12:12:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> or fire
P12:12:07 <AnnihilatorBeta> i want fire
P12:12:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> it burns!

P12:12:46 <AnnihilatorBeta> how about liquid nitrogen too
P12:12:50 <flak> build a house

P12:12:54 <Edur> snow/ice needed

P12:13:08 <JTE> Leaves are the only green thing that doesn't die underground. :(
P12:13:17 <Boinciel> It would turn brown wood blocks grey
P12:13:25 <AnnihilatorBeta> burn other houses and get banned for being a pyro
P12:13:28 <flak> fire is probly not too hard to implement
P12:13:45 <AnnihilatorBeta> pyros are in poverty line
P12:13:48 <AnnihilatorBeta> under
P12:13:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> they deserve more
P12:14:05 <flak> like, every few seconds check if neighbour blocks is on fire
P12:14:22 <Haruhi2> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YersIyzsOpc this is what asperger's syndrome looks like
P12:14:38 <AnnihilatorBeta> i suppose fire would be useful for when survival comes out

P12:16:03 <AnnihilatorBeta> it fits perfectly
P12:16:04 <Haruhi2> where can i get the underside theme
P12:16:09 <Haruhi2> i really love that theme
P12:16:23 <AnnihilatorBeta> download game, get theme from music folder
P12:16:36 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's in pttune format so you need a plugin for that
P12:16:48 <Syndlig> Notch
P12:17:04 <Syndlig> Prototype > inFAMOUS, it's a well-known fact.
P12:17:13 <AnnihilatorBeta> true
P12:17:18 <Notch> but.. but..
P12:17:24 <Notch> well, yeah, it probably is. ;)
P12:17:27 <Syndlig> :P
P12:17:34 <Syndlig> Actually they're both good games in their own right.
P12:17:40 <Notch> inFAMOUS isn't all that great. It's a fun time killer for relaxing sundays, though
P12:17:50 <Syndlig> inFAMOUS is good because you're a jerkass with lightning powers who can go kill people and then revive them
P12:17:53 <Syndlig> Just to kill them again.
P12:17:57 <C418> prototype equals infamous
P12:18:03 <Syndlig> Prototype is good because, well.
P12:18:06 <Hunter712> Moar liek Protohype
P12:18:15 <C418> if you played spiderman 2 on the ps2
P12:18:21 <Hunter712> The constant barrage of missions is so annoying
P12:18:22 <C418> you should notice the similarities
P12:18:36 <Syndlig> You're a jerkass who doesn't give two shits about anyone and will kill swaths of military and civilians just to get what he wants.
P12:18:52 <Syndlig> Plus you can bullet dive through helicopters and onto the ground and create a shockwave that kills like 200 people.
P12:18:54 <C418> thats nothing I care about, really
P12:19:22 <Quatroking> Notch, when can we expect slippery ice?
P12:19:24 <Syndlig> I like my sandbox destruction games to have a little bit of plot to explain why the guy's just running around blowing shit up.
P12:19:56 <Syndlig> Hey, if we get slippery ice can we get snowy ground?  :D
P12:20:10 <Syndlig> Second kind of dirt that "grows" snow instead of grass
P12:20:39 <Hunter712> Ice should cool lava to rock D:
P12:20:41 <Notch> Quatroking: In a few versions. I've got the basic framework for friction and run speed (and particle gravity) set up on tiles
P12:20:42 <smn> <@C418> prototype equals infamous <- but inFAMOUS has Amon Tobin! :(
P12:20:44 <Hunter712> I hate not having lava sponges
P12:20:53 <Quatroking> sweet
P12:21:06 <Notch> but I have to change the player physics for that, and.. well. I've got much to do. :D
P12:21:06 <Quatroking> would it be possible then, notch, to have ice turn water into ice too?
P12:21:17 <Quatroking> but only horizontally
P12:21:24 <Quatroking> and when touched from above
P12:21:30 <citricsquid> when we can pass urls to the skin previewer I can make minecraftskins public =D

P12:23:48 <Ylle> if we could have a standalone skin previewer or something such
P12:23:52 <Ylle> that'd be plain great

P12:50:20 <Notch> great cd, that.
P12:50:27 <Notch> the ep, not so much.
P12:50:36 <C418> the half album you mean?
P12:50:39 <C418> it's totally incredible
P12:50:44 <Notch> it says ep on the sleve!
P12:50:51 <C418> I mean rushup edge
P12:50:55 <C418> it's long enough for a long play
P12:50:57 <Maulrus> it's an EP dammit
P12:51:01 <Maulrus> oh
P12:51:14 <C418> an ep is not an ep when it's over 24 minutes or has more than 5 songs
P12:51:16 <Empty> I love daft punk!
P12:51:20 <Notch> rushup edge is an lp. Confederation Trough is the ep
P12:51:29 <Notch> three songs.
P12:51:34 <C418> three it was?
P12:51:35 <Maulrus> well I don't know the album so >_>
P12:51:40 <C418> oh well, thats too easy
P12:51:49 <Maulrus> though I didn't th ink there was a strict definition for EP

P12:51:58 <C418> it's not strict at all
P12:52:05 <C418> but it's the unwritten rule, kind of
P12:52:16 <C418> you can say your one track one minute song is an album if you want to
P12:52:36 <Maulrus> yeah but that's just being an asshole
P12:52:46 <C418> but thats what indie is all about
P12:52:46 <C418> :D

P12:53:37 <Maulrus> this channel tried to pull some Yes on me
P12:53:40 <Quatroking> hey Notch
P12:53:41 <Maulrus> how bout no
P12:53:58 <Notch> yes?
P12:54:00 <Notch> I mean.. err
P12:54:00 <Quatroking> would it be possible to have servers generate trees optionally
P12:54:19 <Notch> sure, when I do the level gen parameterisation, I'll add that. =)
P12:54:22 <Maulrus> I was thinking about that yesterday
P12:54:25 <Quatroking> so it would be possible to let the server generate maps without those goddamn trees
P12:54:26 <Maulrus> that will be so awesome
P12:54:37 <Quatroking> Ah nice
P12:54:37 <Syndlig> What's wrong with the trees?
P12:54:42 <ZomBuster> Got most of the bugs kinked out now http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cfe8b64d8aeca7fb61c20060840bb0b5
P12:54:44 <Syndlig> I think the maps would look pretty dead without forests.
P12:54:44 <Maulrus> they're inconvenient sometimes
P12:54:47 <Quatroking> Well they're sometimes in the way
P12:54:52 <Quatroking> tand it takes a while to make room
P12:54:55 <Maulrus> like I was building a 60x60 admin box yesterday
P12:54:56 <ZomBuster> need to tweak the values a bit
P12:54:57 <Maulrus> and oh god the trees
P12:55:25 <Notch> i need to add birch
P12:55:34 <Notch> just because the texture would be so very fun to draw. :D
P12:56:51 <AnnihilatorBeta> i wanna make an underground forest

P1:05:11 <Syndlig> Notch, are you changing the glass texture any?
P1:05:16 <Syndlig> It looks kinda ugly.  :x
P1:05:19 <Daidoji> yeah
P1:05:23 <Daidoji> I'd say get rid of the middle part
P1:05:26 <Lmaoboat> He can't do much better
P1:05:31 <Daidoji> actually
P1:05:31 <ZomBuster> I think its fine
P1:05:34 <Daidoji> just slightly tint it
P1:05:37 <citricsquid> I like it :(
P1:05:39 <Wingboy> i like it
P1:05:48 <Lmaoboat> Semi-transparency would cause rendering problems
P1:05:52 <Syndlig> The blatant white lines through it and the white border around every tile's pretty ugly.
P1:06:04 <Daidoji> nonsense
P1:06:10 <smn> why would it, Lmaoboat, isn't water semi-transparent?
P1:06:14 <Maulrus> wingboy: i talk to myself a lot
P1:06:15 <Daidoji> yes
P1:06:20 <Daidoji> water is exactly that
P1:06:21 <Syndlig> smn:  Exactly
P1:06:22 <Maulrus> and I like the glass texture :D
P1:06:28 <Lmaoboat> there are several rendeirng orblems with water
P1:06:35 <Syndlig> So?
P1:06:39 <Daidoji> like what
P1:06:41 <Syndlig> That's why this is alpha and not release
P1:06:43 <Ylle> well uh
P1:06:46 <Ylle> hey uh
P1:06:46 <Syndlig> And why the code's being worked on
P1:06:53 <Syndlig> (i'm assuming)
P1:06:53 <Daidoji> other than the grid thing
P1:06:54 <Lmaoboat> Glass is "safer"
P1:07:06 <Ylle> I had this idea, like, glass who is right next to eachother, meld together...
P1:07:15 <Syndlig> Ylle, they do... sorta?
P1:07:22 <Ylle> yeah but the white lines
P1:07:22 <Syndlig> The interior of blocks isn't rendered.
P1:07:29 <Ylle> so you could have a biiiig glass cueb
P1:07:31 <Syndlig> That'd require multiple blocks though.
P1:07:31 <Daidoji> it can be
P1:07:35 <Daidoji> if notch made it that way
P1:07:46 <Syndlig> He'd have to make a texture for every possible version of that.
P1:07:47 <Haruhi2> glass texture is fine
P1:07:54 <Haruhi2> matches the style of the game
P1:08:13 <Syndlig> I'd be fine with it if it didn't have the lines through the middle obscuring your view.
P1:08:20 <Syndlig> If it was just the border it'd be 100x better.
P1:08:21 <Ylle> Yeah I guess it'd be a little too much to make
P1:08:23 <Daidoji> yeah that's what I was saying
P1:08:26 <Daidoji> the border lines are fine
P1:08:26 <Syndlig> Still visible.
P1:08:32 <Wingboy> w00t i won the build contest :D
P1:08:34 <Syndlig> Yylle, not necessarily.
P1:08:36 <Haruhi2> the border lines are a good thing
P1:08:42 <Haruhi2> otherwise it'd look horrible tiling
P1:08:47 <Syndlig> There's like...
P1:08:59 <Syndlig> 9 textures he'd have to make.
P1:09:28 <Syndlig> Unless you'd want to account for all possible combinations.
P1:09:30 <Syndlig> Then it'd be 25.
P1:09:44 <Syndlig> And Haruhi, why would it look horrible tiling?
P1:09:49 <Daidoji> no
P1:09:50 <Syndlig> The borders are what makes it look horrible tiling.
P1:09:54 <Haruhi2> nope
P1:09:55 <Daidoji> he could flip the textures ingame
P1:10:00 <Syndlig> It doesn't look like a glass wall.
P1:10:06 <Syndlig> It looks like a bunch of white lines stacked on one another.
P1:10:10 <Haruhi2> it looks like glass blocks

P1:11:43 <Wingboy> wut
P1:11:43 <Maulrus> >_>
P1:11:43 <Syndlig> I don't negotiate with terrorists.
P1:11:53 <Maulrus> a guy came into my server
P1:11:56 <Ylle> I use glass sparingly
P1:11:59 <Ylle> it looks okay
P1:12:01 <Maulrus> and said he was a fiji islander
P1:12:09 <Maulrus> and somebody said "fiiiiiijiiiiiii"
P1:12:13 <Ylle> it doesn't look super okay if you make giant skybridges entirely out of glass
P1:12:16 <Ylle> imo
P1:12:30 <Maulrus> then the guy got all offended and said "the great one will pardon you, or punish you"
P1:12:31 <Maulrus> then left
P1:12:46 <Syndlig> You done got cursed
P1:12:49 <Daidoji> half-life used a noise filter and it was moderately visible
P1:12:57 <Haruhi2> who cares about single-pane glass anyway
P1:13:03 <Haruhi2> it looks fine as it is
P1:13:23 <Daidoji> it hurts me to look at
P1:13:41 <Wingboy> or an easier solution- create another glass block and keep both in
P1:14:10 <Syndlig> how's that an easier solution?
P1:15:10 <Zuriki> Hey everyone.
P1:15:38 <Maulrus> hay there
P1:15:38 <Syndlig> Plus, semi-opaque tinting I think is a necessity.
P1:15:54 <Syndlig> So that you can have glass that isn't just a completely clear block with white lines on it.
P1:16:01 <Daidoji> ruby and emerald blocks
P1:16:05 <Haruhi2> but then it wouldn't look like glass
P1:16:07 <Syndlig> Stained glass windows.
P1:16:10 <Syndlig> Um?
P1:16:26 <Syndlig> Stained glass isn't completely transparent, nor does it have LINES going through it.
P1:16:27 <Haruhi2> it'd have to be very very lightly tinted
P1:16:33 <Daidoji> the current one doesn't look like glass ~what the HELL people~
P1:16:45 <Syndlig> Hell, most stained glass is damn difficult to see through and is purely decorative.
P1:17:07 <Daidoji> there's varying types
P1:17:28 <Syndlig> Well there's a difference between STAINED glass and COLORED glass.
P1:17:31 <Haruhi2> the version that was semi-opaque looked more like ice than glass

P1:18:12 <Haruhi2> then he changed it a bit and now it doesn't really look like either
P1:18:14 <akuryo> NOTCH
P1:18:17 <akuryo> ITS VERY URGENT
10P1:18:17 * C419 is now known as C418
P1:18:22 <Syndlig> It's not fine, though.  It's not glass.
P1:18:25 <Daidoji> yes it's urgent we have a GLASS crisis
10P1:18:26 * ChanServ sets mode: +o C418
P1:18:31 <akuryo> erm
P1:18:32 <Syndlig> GLASS CRISIS OH GOD
P1:18:33 <akuryo> yeah too
P1:18:38 <akuryo> but my problem is serious
P1:18:39 <akuryo> really
P1:18:43 <akuryo> it's not matter of update
P1:18:44 <Haruhi2> it looks as much like glass as any 16-bit glass could ever look
P1:18:45 <Daidoji> are you being molested by bears
P1:18:46 <akuryo> or suggestion
P1:18:50 <akuryo> becaue the forum is there fore
P1:18:59 <akuryo> notch are you there?
P1:19:04 <Syndlig> Spit it out, son.

P1:19:13 <Maulrus> please no
P1:19:21 <Haruhi2> i liked it better when it didn't make other sides of the glass disappear when looked through

P1:19:43 <Daidoji> that's because he's using an alpha, haurhi
P1:19:49 <Daidoji> instead of making the entire block translucent
P1:19:59 <Syndlig> I don't think the game renders faces that aren't visible.
P1:20:03 <Syndlig> Rather, he doesn't use occlusion.
P1:20:08 <Daidoji> it won't
P1:20:13 <Syndlig> Just any block face that touches another block is simply not rendered.
P1:20:27 <Daidoji> if the block itself is translucent you can see all sides
P1:20:36 <Syndlig> With exceptions like glass and leaves where you can see through them.
P1:20:48 <Haruhi2> i don't want the glass to look too opaque
P1:20:51 <Syndlig> Otherwise the game would lag to high hell on even a 64^3 map.
P1:20:56 <Syndlig> Well.
P1:20:57 <Daidoji> what
P1:21:00 <Syndlig> That's why we compromise.
P1:21:00 <Daidoji> no it wouldn't
P1:21:00 <Haruhi2> glass is very clear
10P1:21:02 * Roras (user3681@cpe-72-184-170-97.tampabay.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
P1:21:06 <Daidoji> unless you have a video card from 10 years ago
P1:21:07 <Syndlig> Why would it look opaque?
P1:21:18 <Syndlig> To fix the current glass all you need to do is remove the 3 lines in the middle.
P1:21:21 <Syndlig> And it'll look like glass.
P1:21:27 <Syndlig> It'll still be easily visible due to the border lines.
P1:21:34 <Syndlig> But you won't have irritating LINES through it.
P1:21:40 <Syndlig> Well, lines through the viewing area.
P1:21:51 <Syndlig> If the lines were semitransparent that would be good as well.
P1:21:53 <Haruhi2> i don't like the lines in the middle either
P1:21:53 <flak> it's fine with diagonal lines
P1:22:00 <flak> but border looks terrible
P1:22:10 <Syndlig> It needs something for you to be able to see it's there.
P1:22:10 <Haruhi2> just the border is fine
P1:22:13 <akuryo> YEAH
P1:22:17 <akuryo> HURRAH FOR THE OLD GLASS
P1:22:20 <Haruhi2> flak if it were just the diagonal lines it'd look terrible tiling
P1:22:23 <Syndlig> If it was a mutable border it would work better.
P1:22:27 <flak> with just the border it will look like wireframe carcass
P1:22:29 <akuryo> the old glass look so sexy <3
P1:22:31 <ZomBuster> wow a voronoi texture makes cool caves
P1:22:35 <Haruhi2> flak
P1:22:36 <Syndlig> Like, if the border conformed to the shape of the glass structure.
P1:22:38 <Haruhi2> look at normal glass

P1:22:56 <chilley> whats new in twenty two
P1:22:57 <Syndlig> You use textures instead of filters?
P1:23:20 <akuryo> hey
P1:23:25 <akuryo> you knoz what
P1:23:29 <akuryo> add this game
P1:23:33 <akuryo> an online texture drawing
P1:23:36 <akuryo> and uploading to the server
P1:23:45 <akuryo> it's so pixelised, it doesn't take more than some octets
P1:23:54 <Haruhi2> also flak he already did the diagonal lines only thing and it looked horrible
P1:23:55 <Daidoji> http://www.cs-maps.jolt.co.uk/tutorials/glass2.jpg
P1:23:57 <Daidoji> this one looks wonky
P1:24:04 <chilley> and text signs, a juke box, hamburgers and vodoo dolls
P1:24:08 <Daidoji> it has the sheen lines in it, but it would look better if it was even more translucent
P1:24:42 <Haruhi2> Daidoji, that looks more like crystal or ice
P1:24:47 <chilley> guys remember its java
P1:24:51 <chilley> java means sloooooow
P1:25:07 <Daidoji> because it's opaque
P1:25:26 <Daidoji> if it's highly translucent it will look more like glass
P1:25:30 <Roras> huh
P1:25:42 <Roras> i am learning java right now
P1:25:46 <chilley> and take three times performance Daidoji
P1:25:53 <Roras> like i just got a book
P1:25:57 <Daidoji> no it won't
P1:26:02 <Daidoji> where the fuck did you get that idea?
P1:26:10 <Syndlig> Why would it take a performance hit?
P1:26:15 <Syndlig> I mean, it might take like
P1:26:26 <Syndlig> Nothing.
P1:26:30 <Syndlig> Really, it won't take anything extra.
P1:26:44 <Roras> >.>
P1:26:44 <Daidoji> textures are almost a zero performance issue these days
P1:26:49 <Haruhi2> he'd have to z-sort everything
P1:27:01 <Daidoji> unless you're talking stupidly huge sized textures then it's just a matter of ram.
P1:27:12 <Daidoji> but as far as fps hit, it's zero.
P1:27:19 <chilley> ah whatever. notch is master :P and has 2do the work
P1:27:37 <Syndlig> http://i40.tinypic.com/2m6vkus.jpg  7 glass pane textures.
P1:27:54 <Syndlig> Covers every possible combination of glass blocks.
P1:28:06 <Daidoji> what are the dotted ones for
P1:28:11 <Syndlig> Interior corners.
P1:28:16 <Syndlig> This doesn't cover them all, sorry.

P1:28:24 <Syndlig> They're not actual textures

P1:28:31 <Syndlig> 9 textures.

P1:29:11 <Daidoji> anyway yeah that's better
P1:29:17 <Daidoji> without the blue bits, it's a subtle line thing.
P1:29:23 <Haruhi2> doesn't cover t sections
P1:29:34 <Syndlig> I'm aware.
P1:29:44 <Syndlig> It covers everything up to a point.
P1:29:51 <Syndlig> Because otherwise it's like
P1:29:57 <Syndlig> 20 fucking textures for one color of glass.
P1:30:11 <Syndlig> Well no.
P1:30:12 <Syndlig> 11 but still.

P1:33:14 <Syndlig> http://i39.tinypic.com/ws03ye.jpg 12 textures.
P1:33:19 <Notch> not yet, Siiseli, but good idea =D
P1:33:20 <Siiseli> as stated in tigirc.
P1:33:28 <Siiseli> yeah just throwing that ball to you
P1:33:33 <Daidoji> you ever thought about allowing higher res stuff for mods?

P1:34:07 <Siiseli> the whole look
P1:34:07 <Haruhi2> it's a good style
P1:34:08 <Syndlig> If partial transparency is added then those 12 textures can easily cover any color of glass.
P1:34:10 <Daidoji> just saying, for a mod.
P1:34:28 <Siiseli> uh how much did the game cost
P1:34:33 <smn> oh and by the way Notch OH MY GOD THAT 3 LINES OF CODE YOU ADDED ARE SO AWESOME
13P1:34:37 * smn humps the .log file
P1:34:39 <akuryo> i sent both mail
P1:34:44 <Syndlig> Just make the center of the glass white with 100% transparency for "normal glass"
P1:34:47 <akuryo> can you do my request please?
P1:34:48 <Siiseli> and Notch how long will the alpha be going 
P1:34:56 <Notch> until surival mode is released
P1:34:58 <Syndlig> Then make it partially transparent with a color overlay for stained glass.
P1:34:58 <Siiseli> cos' I'ma get some money next month
P1:35:02 <Notch> then it'll be beta until survival mode works well
P1:35:04 <akuryo> Notch
P1:35:07 <Siiseli> then I'll have time
P1:35:12 <Siiseli> I.. think?
P1:35:17 <Notch> survival mode's been delayed a bit due to bugs and clean up work. =)
P1:35:18 <Notch> so yeah
P1:35:19 <Daidoji> then it's time for ZOMBIES
P1:35:20 <akuryo> notch
P1:35:26 <akuryo> can you check your mailbox please?
P1:35:27 <Siiseli> you'll leave freebuilding as an option right?

P1:35:34 <Mode> Man, it's like I have some kind of psychic power that alerts me any time someone talks about Survival mode.
P1:35:35 <Maulrus> I'm actually looking forward to zombie mode more than survival a little
P1:35:35 <akuryo> like sauerbraten
P1:35:40 <Notch> it's a very popular play mode. =)
P1:35:44 <Daidoji> notch do me a favor and make zombie siege as bloody and gritty as possible

P1:35:48 <Notch> lol
P1:35:53 <Maulrus> of course, I'm gonna LOVE survival
P1:35:54 <akuryo> so bloody
P1:35:55 <Daidoji> maybe you could bring back the random offset for zombie mode
P1:35:57 <akuryo> will there be weapons?
P1:35:57 <Maulrus> it's gonna be intense
P1:35:58 <Daidoji> to give it that gritty feel
P1:36:01 <Haruhi2> hey Notch
P1:36:11 <Haruhi2> could you try the current glass without the lines in the middle?
P1:36:12 <Syndlig> Zombie mode would be hilarious if it was like Clonk.
P1:36:15 <smn> uhhh that's one bad-ass idea Daidoji
P1:36:21 <Syndlig> Where when the zombies die they explode into blood.
P1:36:24 <Syndlig> Which slowly fills up the map.
P1:36:32 <akuryo> Notch
P1:36:32 <Maulrus> :o that sounds awesome
P1:36:34 <Syndlig> Since blood liquid never goes away.

P1:39:31 <Haruhi2> lol
P1:39:36 <ZomBuster> Make a seperate screen name
P1:39:39 <ZomBuster> which can be altered
P1:39:46 <Syndlig> People've already hacked the textures to make custom ones.
P1:39:53 <akuryo> i sent another message
P1:39:53 <Zuriki> I do all the time
P1:39:55 <akuryo> from the black geek
P1:39:56 <akuryo> one time again
P1:40:04 <akuryo> tell me if its ok
P1:40:12 <Syndlig> So just extract the texture file, modify, recompile, load up and screenshot.
P1:40:16 <ZomBuster> Every (paid) game account you should be able to change the screenname 
P1:40:17 <Zuriki> I have several textures for different things like snow land, wasteland, slobcraft
P1:40:18 <Syndlig> Repeat for the other method.
P1:40:20 <Syndlig> Post and compare.
P1:40:23 <akuryo> yeah
P1:40:26 <akuryo> i agree with syndlig
P1:40:28 <akuryo> change screenname
P1:40:36 <akuryo> and keyboard settings!!!!
P1:40:36 <Syndlig> Zuriki:  how does one do that, anyways?
P1:40:37 <Haruhi2> okay then somebody do it
P1:40:41 <Zuriki> So what?
P1:40:44 <Haruhi2> so we can settle this dumb argument
P1:40:47 <Zuriki> Do*
P1:40:50 <Syndlig> I wanna mess with textures but I couldn't figure out how to extract the texture file or put it back in.
P1:40:58 <Zuriki> Oh, JAR = ZIP
P1:40:59 <akuryo> where is the java file?
P1:41:03 <akuryo> .jar
P1:41:06 <akuryo> i wanna know

P2:03:21 <Deiz> Notch: I have some ideas re: block selection. I'm not really a fan of the 'slot' style, I'd rather have the block bar have 10-15 blocks on it, keep the selected block centered, and marquee through them. I think the inventory should mostly be a colour picker in creative mode, as opposed to being used for most block selection.
P2:03:25 <Haruhi2> Notch I wanna DF-style Adventure mode

P2:25:50 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh
P2:26:04 <Haruhi2> Pizza Hut is slicing the "pizza" from its boxes and some store signs. The fast food chain will now brand some stores as simply "The Hut."
P2:26:04 <Haruhi2> However, contrary to earlier reports, the iconic chain won't be changing its name, a Pizza Hut spokesman said Friday. The boxes and some store signs will say "The Hut." Others will retain the Pizza Hut name.
P2:26:10 <Quatroking> What the fuck does hoth mean
P2:26:23 <doohan> I expect to see mars soon Quatroking 
P2:26:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> oh cool

P2:32:49 <citricsquid> rroff: I was building a control panel for minecraftservers.com, but because we can't specify IPs for a server I stopped =( cba with a VPS per server, too much effort.

P3:10:20 <Notch> does autoclick work now?
P3:10:23 <Mode> I'm more used to the mushroom analogy.

P3:12:50 <Miclee> I was gonna say it!

P3:13:02 <citricsquid> 17k registered users!
P3:13:10 <Dilt> how many preorders?
P3:13:14 <AlLnAtuRalX> 12k are griefers!
P3:13:15 <citricsquid> 526
P3:13:19 <Dilt> haven't gotten to get to walmart yet and pay up
P3:13:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I noticed that, if any plant is in the shade, and you move your cursor over it while in delete mode, a transparent white box will appear like normal, but the actual plant sprites will vanish.
P3:13:28 <Dilt> so that's 5260 euros or so
P3:13:30 <citricsquid> It's a very good conversion rate!

P3:18:35 <ez> u cant be blamed for everything
P3:18:55 <citricsquid> I wasn't allowed molotovs, because my mouse would spin constantly and I'd end up setting everyone on fire =D
P3:19:01 <ez> lol
P3:19:30 <Siiseli> mm well yeah for example, getting yelled at for wasting a tank when you spawn in the middle of the other team and get lit on fire before getting control and they have autoshotties
P3:19:32 <ez> that was funny, when Notch first shot all of us .. then through a molotov at us trying to save the situation
P3:19:36 <Siiseli> so I basically spawned at half health
P3:19:37 <Siiseli> on fire

P3:22:08 <Bobobo> Notch: nice work over the last few days :)
P3:22:16 <Bobobo> the sponges worked out nice
P3:22:27 <Notch> thanks. Although I was hard at work before that as well, only not on stuff that shows as clearly. ;)
P3:22:27 <Bobobo> still a pain in the ass to get rid of flooded areas haha
P3:22:28 <ZomBuster> and the colors are.. colorfull!
P3:22:31 <Bobobo> in a good way though
P3:22:34 <Siiseli> Notch, private message system would be highly.. wished for
P3:22:40 <Notch> ingame?
P3:22:43 <citricsquid> I love the sponges, they don't function how I imagined but they make for excellent water manipulation :D
P3:22:55 <ZomBuster> and nick autocomplete!
P3:22:55 <Notch> yeah, exactly how I feel about them, citricsquid
P3:23:02 <Notch> I kept trying various complicated solutions
P3:23:04 <Dilt> eee
P3:23:07 <Siiseli> Bobobo, yeah someone on the tigs server made an underground cavern and hideous flooded it :|
P3:23:11 <Siiseli> before the sponge
P3:23:13 <Notch> but then I went "FUCK IT ALL TO HELL" and brute forced it
P3:23:14 <Siiseli> that was ye olde server
P3:23:21 <Notch> I curse a lot when frustrated.
P3:23:25 <citricsquid> notch: lmao, well it worked!
P3:23:34 <Redshift> lmao

P3:23:41 <Dilt> so gys
P3:23:44 <Siiseli> water walls are fun to make
P3:23:53 <Dilt> i haven't tuned into minecraft since the client/server were freshly released

P3:24:23 <Notch> of course =D
P3:24:28 <Dilt> of course :P
P3:24:32 <Dilt> but i see an interm solution was made
P3:24:36 <Dilt> viavi sponges.
P3:24:54 <Notch> visavis?
P3:25:01 <flak> with sponges you can make flying water pools
P3:25:09 <Notch> haha yes
P3:25:16 <Notch> and really cool air bubbles under water
P3:25:18 <LazyWaffle> Is Maulrus' server back up?
P3:25:19 <flak> or underwater bubble
P3:25:20 <Dilt> how feasable is a 'halfwater' tile?
P3:25:25 <Dilt> well
P3:25:26 <Notch> Dilt: fairly
P3:25:36 <Notch> i'm still debating the best way to deal with stuff
P3:25:40 <Dilt> if you really do try a finite water solution, you could go the DF route

P3:26:27 <Notch> I'm going to spend some time on sound first, I've promised C418 to get started on that
P3:26:33 <peerkoel> I've already seen some crazy waterworks with sponges
P3:26:33 <Dilt> yeah, can't wait for that.
P3:26:35 <Siiseli> LazyWaffle, it's about survival
P3:26:36 <C418> :D
P3:26:38 <citricsquid> sounds ftw, make sure it's muteable though ;D
P3:26:40 <Dilt> i want to hear what C418 interperts minecraft as
P3:26:44 <Notch> yes, citricsquid =)
P3:26:52 <LazyWaffle> Hold on, are you interested in 8-bit sound effects?
P3:26:57 <Lmaoboat> I hope survival has the feeling of advneture infiniminer had
P3:26:57 <Dilt> music can change the entire theme of a game

P3:27:08 <Notch> me too, Lmaoboat. =)
P3:27:10 <LazyWaffle> I know a great program for 8 bit sounds
P3:27:14 <ez> one option for music and one for sound effects would be good aswell
P3:27:19 <Notch> the game idea I originally got when playing infiniminer was the survival game

P3:27:24 <Notch> this whole thing I've got now is just the engine
P3:27:27 <citricsquid> Notch: Do you plan on having music and sound effects, with the option to disable each individually? That would be nice ;)
P3:27:35 <Notch> but it turned out popular, so I'm keeping it as "creative mode"
P3:27:42 <Dilt> oh, C418
P3:27:44 <Lmaoboat> I loved the feeling of setting up remote bases in dangerours areas surrounded by lava
P3:27:45 <ez> thats what I meant citricsquid
P3:27:47 <Notch> yes, there will be both effects and music
P3:27:53 <Dilt> i have a question. Would you care if Notch had your music files straight up in a folder?
P3:27:56 <Dilt> so we could play them seperately?
P3:28:00 <PaperbagBoy> Argh! Fuck. I keep crashing after like 30 seconds when I join a server
P3:28:05 <LazyWaffle> Notch, don't let other's opinions change your view of the game
P3:28:17 <Lmaoboat> yes
P3:28:18 <Notch> LazyWaffle: I like creative mode too, but it wasn't the original idea
P3:28:20 <Lmaoboat> except for mine
P3:28:22 <LazyWaffle> Something I have trouble with is making a game that I don't enjoy making
P3:28:28 <Dilt> LazyWaffle: indeed
P3:28:31 <Notch> i do let people color my ideas if they have good arguments
P3:28:38 <Dilt> but if he does something stupid, it's our job to stop him
P3:28:38 <Notch> i think it leads to a better game that way
P3:28:40 <Dilt> i mean seriously notch
P3:28:42 <LazyWaffle> I only finished 1 game because that one game was one I enjoyed to make
P3:28:43 <Notch> absolutely
P3:28:49 <Dilt> hosting an http page for multiplayer?
P3:28:55 <_spondy> so will the whole block make/destroy mechanic be in the game itself?
P3:28:55 <Notch> ?
P3:28:56 <citricsquid> making stuff you're top 100% about is too hard =(
P3:28:59 <Dilt> that's like ASKING for your userbase to get spammed with goatse
P3:28:59 <Notch> lol dilt

P3:29:09 <Notch> sometimes I'm not clever =D
P3:29:11 <LazyWaffle> For example, I'm not a huge fan of RTS's, so I couldn't keep my attention on making it and would give up
P3:29:15 <Siiseli> I just recently finished my flash game
P3:29:17 <Siiseli> it was a pain
P3:29:24 <Dilt> but yeah
P3:29:25 <Siiseli> my graphician kind of quit
P3:29:29 <Dilt> code whatever you want to notch
P3:29:29 <Siiseli> for some bizarre reasons
P3:29:36 <ZomBuster> graphician ?lol
P3:29:36 <Dilt> don't let your thousand fans distract you

P3:30:49 <Dilt> yes lazy
P3:30:54 <LazyWaffle> Because it looks like it only accepts pounds
P3:30:54 <Dilt> not only is it possible, but it's automatic
P3:30:59 <Notch> dilt: I like being distracted by fans
P3:31:01 <Dilt> paypal autochanges ccurrencies, iirc

P3:50:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh yeah Notch, I've been meaning to ask you, what do you think of all the people trying to make Minecraft level editors?
P3:50:59 <Dilt> and, uh
P3:51:05 <ZomBuster> nop
P3:51:10 <ZomBuster> no difference in menu
P3:51:12 <vdgmprgrmr> And regarding Lmaoboat's suggestion, I agree.
P3:51:12 <Dilt> i think i'm gonna toss out the Bare Grounds/Epic Cityscapes from the main page
P3:51:15 <Dilt> they're kinda distracting
P3:51:18 <LazyWaffle> Guys, I'm seriously eating cake right now.
P3:51:19 <ZomBuster> stays on ~400
P3:51:21 <Dilt> and don't really serve much purpose
P3:51:22 <Siiseli> FoxBlitzz, in the tigsource topic
P3:51:24 <LazyWaffle> CAKE.
P3:51:48 <Notch> vdgmprgrmr: I don't mind it at all. More content for the players, and it doesn't ruin mp for anyone
P3:51:53 <FoxBlitzz> Also, why would going into the menu increase the FPS that much?
P3:51:53 <Notch> in fact, it makes mp more varied and fun

P4:33:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Sandbox should be like God Mode.
P4:33:06 <yoshibot> yes
P4:33:19 <Inschato> Though what do I care, I havn't bought the game, and have no plans to, so once beta is over.. :P
P4:33:30 <yoshibot> i'd consider it.
P4:33:34 <Hunter712> Or you could have some sort of option for Sandbox if you want player to have god or not
P4:33:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Inschato, why not buy it?
P4:33:45 <vdgmprgrmr> Or do you plan on obtaining it some other way?
13P4:33:52 * Inschato stands up, grabs his pockets, and pulls out some lint.

P4:34:16 <Dilt> piracy
P4:34:20 <Dilt> arrr :D
P4:34:21 <Inschato> That wouldn't work for this

P4:34:34 <LKA> it'll be drm-free though iirc
P4:34:36 <Inschato> And I wouldn't admit to such a strategy in this very channel if that was my plan :P
P4:34:39 <Dilt> yoshibot: which makes it all the easier to be piratd, technically
P4:34:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Sure it would, once the game becomes more standalone and less web-based.
P4:34:46 <Dilt> and Inschato, notch already said he doesn't care
P4:34:47 <yoshibot> just spoof the server, right.
P4:34:54 <Dilt> some people simply don't pay
11P4:34:57 <DBN> a legit server would not accept people whose accounts don't own the game
P4:35:01 <Inschato> It's different for me if I know the developer, even if not very well :P
P4:35:01 <Dilt> and he doesn't expect to magic up money
P4:35:04 <vdgmprgrmr> And Notch has explicitly stated that if you can't afford, he doesn't care if you get it "some other way".
P4:35:07 <Dilt> but if he can magic up more fame, that would work
P4:35:19 <yoshibot> he's already magicking up some fame here
P4:35:28 <vdgmprgrmr> DBN, why?
P4:35:33 <Inschato> 527 purchases seems pretty good for a game I'd never heard of until a few weeks ago
11P4:35:35 <DBN> simple authentication

P4:35:47 <Daidoji> because it never existed until a few weeks ago :v
11P4:35:50 <DBN> you'd have to make a cracked server
P4:35:52 <Inschato> It's over 5000 euroez!
P4:36:02 <Dilt> which isn't hard, DBN
P4:36:05 <Quatroking> almost OVER 9000
P4:36:08 <Dilt> especially if you're good with your packet cracking
P4:36:12 <vdgmprgrmr> As in, if you pirate it, you get the exact same thing as if you buy it.
P4:36:18 <Inschato> Err, no.. those purchases are at the alpha price of 9.95
11P4:36:18 <DBN> point is you wouldn't be able to play on most public servers

P5:00:47 <Trevor> I don't think updating drivers helps this error... but I'll try it
P5:00:52 <Trevor> I thought they were already updated is all.
P5:01:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Updating drivers helps it.
P5:01:29 <Inschato> Updating java, too
P5:01:33 <Trevor> java is updated
P5:01:36 <vdgmprgrmr> I got it once after reinstalling windows, and updating drivers fixed it.

P5:04:50 <Rroff> when it freezes it takes out my NIC :(
P5:04:51 <Trevor> besides, they would've been at the newest when I installed windows 7, and I doubt it has bene updated since then
P5:05:10 <Rroff> no network traffic until I kill the locked up browser window
P5:05:11 <Inschato> I know what I want, I want an insert ability
P5:05:19 <Inschato> So that I can change a block without having to blow it up first
P5:05:20 <yoshibot> that's a real WTF
P5:05:43 <Trevor> Inschato, that's only really convenient when you're like holding water back with something.. which can be fixed with a sponge anyways
P5:05:47 <Trevor> otherwise it's not that much effort ;)
P5:06:11 <Inschato> Yeah, I would love to be able to draw a line of sponge in the wall without having to blow up the wall first :P
P5:06:15 <Rroff> wonder if my timer fix proggie fixes the freezes too - would be a long stretch tho
P5:06:28 <vdgmprgrmr> Sponges won't always work this way, though.

P5:06:44 <Inschato> True, I can think of other uses for it though.. barely
P5:06:46 <Maulrus> I am SO sorry, guys on my server
P5:06:51 <Maulrus> it should be up again
P5:07:01 <Trevor> lol, I love sponges. They have a gazillion uses
P5:07:07 <Trevor> Dunno what you're talking about :P
P5:07:08 <Maulrus> I can't get on, thouhg :c
P5:07:09 <vdgmprgrmr> Link, Maulrus?
P5:07:18 <Maulrus> hm
P5:07:23 <Inschato> Sponges will either not exist at all in the final version, or they'll just destory water that flows into them
P5:07:24 <Maulrus> lemme make it private real quick
P5:07:28 <Inschato> That's my guess
P5:07:32 <Trevor> I help not
P5:07:34 <Trevor> that'd suck
P5:07:42 <vdgmprgrmr> That's probably how it'll be.
P5:07:44 <Trevor> I love sponges D=
P5:07:44 <Inschato> Literetely
P5:07:49 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, like actual sponges do.
P5:07:57 <Maulrus> I'm guessing I just make it public = false?
P5:08:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Currently sponges are magical.
P5:08:01 <Trevor> Who cares what actual sponges do, it's not exactly a game based on realism
P5:08:03 <Trevor> *laughs*
P5:08:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, Maulrus, that's right.

P5:10:48 <iamnotcameron> can anyone play anymore?
P5:11:02 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, people can play.
P5:11:04 <iamnotcameron> is everyone's fps going crazy and crashing their browser?
P5:11:07 <Scaredsim> You can, but it keeps crashing
P5:11:15 <iamnotcameron> yeah, that's my point lol :)
P5:11:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I can play just fine.
P5:11:24 <Inschato> There's a bug, notch even said so in the release notes :P
P5:11:26 <iamnotcameron> i'm getting upwards of 600 fps
P5:11:29 <ControlVolume> just more proof that macs and pcs are not compatible in the least
P5:11:31 <iamnotcameron> fair does
P5:11:31 <Scaredsim> My FPS is still stable, getting as much FPS as before the update
P5:11:32 <Inschato> I quote "Oddly, fps goes up a lot when in a game menu. This probably means there�s a bug somewhere."

P5:12:07 <iamnotcameron> then my broswer crashes
P5:12:41 <iamnotcameron> you say yours hasn't changed, scaredsim?
P5:12:46 <Scaredsim> Yep
P5:12:50 <iamnotcameron> =/
P5:12:57 <Scaredsim> I still get the 500 fps I was getting before the update
P5:13:07 <iamnotcameron> and that doesn;t crash you?
P5:13:12 <iamnotcameron> i was getting in the 300s
P5:13:14 <Maulrus> hm
P5:13:16 <Scaredsim> It does now
P5:13:16 <iamnotcameron> and i could handle it
P5:13:21 <Maulrus> 25565 isn't forwarded?
P5:13:21 <Maulrus> wat
P5:13:33 <Scaredsim> Before the update I had 500 fps, no crash
P5:13:36 <ControlVolume> i get around 300-400, but I got that before the update
P5:13:39 <Scaredsim> After : 500 fps, crash
P5:13:40 <Miclee> I'm getting a new graphics card soon :D
P5:13:42 <iamnotcameron> i had 300 before
P5:13:45 <iamnotcameron> then i staretd crashing
P5:13:51 <iamnotcameron> i downloaded the new server zip
P5:13:52 <ZomBuster> me too
P5:13:56 <ControlVolume> the crashing is new to this update
P5:14:00 <iamnotcameron> and now i have 600+ and can't play for even a minute
P5:14:07 <iamnotcameron> and everyone on the forums seems o be the same
P5:14:10 <Scaredsim> Wait, I did not update my server
P5:14:15 <Scaredsim> Do we need to?
P5:14:21 <iamnotcameron> i've got a half decent radeon
P5:14:25 <iamnotcameron> i know people hate them
P5:14:33 <iamnotcameron> or my friends hate them lol
P5:14:34 <ControlVolume> scaredsim, single player crashes as well
P5:14:50 <iamnotcameron> but it's pretty good, and i never lag in other games
P5:14:54 <iamnotcameron> so it's not my gpu
P5:15:09 <ControlVolume> i've got an 8600 gts
P5:15:10 <iamnotcameron> i don't know
P5:15:13 <Scaredsim> Ok, I hope Notch releases 0.0.21a_01 soon
P5:15:14 <iamnotcameron> i did when i started crashing
P5:15:17 <iamnotcameron> played a while longer
P5:15:20 <iamnotcameron> then it went crazy
P5:15:31 <Maulrus> ah
P5:15:34 <iamnotcameron> 2 secs, i'll see what i have
P5:15:34 <Maulrus> it's not forwarded
P5:15:35 <Maulrus> wat
P5:15:45 <iamnotcameron> it's a prebuilt hp pavilion laptop
P5:15:49 <iamnotcameron> the top specone i think
P5:16:02 <Roras> why does grass not grow when there is no grass?
P5:16:21 <ControlVolume> roras, grass spreads
P5:16:26 <iamnotcameron> ATI Mobility Radeoin HD 2600 XT
P5:16:30 <iamnotcameron> probabily pretty crappy
P5:16:35 <Roras> :(
P5:16:38 <Maulrus> oh wow
P5:16:39 <ControlVolume> so you need to have grass next to ordinary dirt in order for grass to grow
P5:16:40 <Roras> i wihs i could make a sky island
P5:16:40 <Maulrus> I feel stupid
P5:16:42 <Maulrus> I didn't save it
P5:16:43 <Maulrus> >_>
P5:16:46 <iamnotcameron> but it runs the source engien fien on my steam games
P5:16:50 <Scaredsim> I have a XFX Radeon HD 4870 1gb
P5:16:56 <Roras> i wihs i could make a sky island softened with grass
P5:17:02 <ControlVolume> you can with alot of time
P5:17:05 <Maulrus> k guys
P5:17:05 <Maulrus> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cb028fbc9af025914a76c8cad3beea70
P5:17:05 <Maulrus> try please
P5:17:20 <iamnotcameron> make a dirt pillar next to some grass
P5:17:29 <iamnotcameron> then just edge off over the edge and look down
P5:17:34 <iamnotcameron> to place a block on the edge
P5:17:36 <iamnotcameron> and carry on
P5:17:43 <iamnotcameron> the grass shoulkd spread i think
P5:17:56 <ControlVolume> you need the grass on top of the pillar before you start building the island, though
P5:18:08 <Maulrus> greenslimy, LazyWaffle
P5:18:11 <Maulrus> server is back up
P5:18:13 <ControlVolume> otherwise the other blocks you build will just shade the other grass
P5:18:16 <iamnotcameron> if he dirt is ona  different level, will it still spread?
P5:18:17 <Maulrus> for real this time :D
P5:18:21 <Maulrus> no
P5:18:22 <iamnotcameron> aslong as it's touching on the bottom?
P5:18:36 <ControlVolume> as far as i've seen, yes
P5:18:49 <Maulrus> oh
P5:18:50 <ControlVolume> but as far as i've seen only includes grass spreading two a dirt block two tiles lower
P5:19:05 <iamnotcameron> so
P5:19:05 <Maulrus> not in my experience, but I could be very wrong
P5:19:09 <iamnotcameron> he could build steps?
P5:19:14 <ControlVolume> that too
P5:19:22 <Maulrus> btw LazyWaffle, it's private now
P5:19:22 <iamnotcameron> then do the whole edging off and lookign down to build his sky platform?

P6:31:31 <AlLnAtuRalX> It shouldn't.. Does it show up in the Greasemonkey bar thing when you are on the server page?

P6:32:03 <PuyoDead> the icon is on, but it says no scripts installed... but it's in the list
P6:32:28 <Testvan> minecraft now pegs out my processor 
P6:32:33 <Testvan> probably related to the crashing
P6:32:57 <PuyoDead> does it not like FF 3.5?
P6:33:28 <AlLnAtuRalX> PuyoDead, are you sure you installed my version?
P6:33:34 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's BiggerMine 2 (FIXED)
P6:33:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> the original had that bug
P6:33:44 <PuyoDead> yup, just followed the link
P6:33:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> h/o
P6:33:57 <PuyoDead> oh crap, FF crashed again
P6:34:06 <Deiz> Testvan: The FPS limit was only in place for a release or two.
P6:34:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> okay, puyo

P6:34:26 <AlLnAtuRalX> edit my script

P6:34:45 <AlLnAtuRalX> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp*
P6:34:49 <AlLnAtuRalX> is that the entry under included pages?
P6:34:52 <Testvan> deiz: i've had my FPS limited to 60 for weeks
P6:34:58 <Deiz> Yeah?
P6:35:04 <PuyoDead> yup
P6:35:09 <Deiz> Then you have vsync on, probably.
P6:35:13 <Testvan> yes i do
P6:35:17 <Deiz> I had a FPS limit of 100 for a release or two.
P6:35:32 <PuyoDead> wait..
P6:35:34 <Deiz> At which point I saw gentle CPU usage
P6:35:43 <AlLnAtuRalX> wait?
P6:35:44 <Testvan> so why is mine maxed out
P6:35:45 <Testvan> now
P6:35:57 <Deiz> No idea. Ask Notch, he's the breaker of things.
12P6:36:17 * Taneru (chatzilla@d24-57-18-245.home.cgocable.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
P6:37:11 <Testvan> someone call up notch and report this bug
P6:37:22 <Deiz> Notch needs internal testing.
P6:37:43 <Deiz> Alpha or not, making your entire userbase suffer for 8+ hours (Assuming he's asleep) is a great way to lose players.
P6:37:51 <PuyoDead> nope, still doesn't work
11P6:38:07 <DBN> notch took out the franerate limiter cus it was buggy
11P6:38:18 <DBN> framerate*
P6:38:19 <Testvan> *releases new version* *instanly falls asleep*
P6:39:32 <Testvan> without vsync on i get 1000 fps and fuck that
P6:39:46 <Deiz> Mmhmm
P6:40:18 <AnnihilatorBeta> it's beaut.
10P6:40:59 * ObAway is now known as Obnubulation
P6:41:07 <Obnubulation> Pray tell, vsync, where is this option?
P6:41:26 <Testvan> i only know about ati
P6:41:38 <Obnubulation> Ah, system options somewhere then?
P6:41:55 <Testvan> ya in the graphic's card options
13P6:42:09 * Obnubulation guesses he could probably figure it out, but decides he's too lazy
P6:43:02 <Testvan> strange that a game like minecraft needs so much CPU power
11P6:43:21 <DBN> it uses as much as you have
11P6:43:23 <DBN> no limiter
11P6:43:37 <DBN> if you have dual core you can limit it to only 1 core
11P6:43:42 <DBN> (tis what i do)
P6:43:56 <Testvan> i do that too
P6:44:01 <Testvan> but it gets my shit hot
P6:44:10 <AlLnAtuRalX> Minecraft makes me hot also
P6:44:13 <AlLnAtuRalX> wait, what?
11P6:44:15 <DBN> i also underclock my video card
P6:44:16 <Obnubulation> Bless the sponge tile
P6:44:53 <AnnihilatorBeta> gah.
11P6:44:56 <DBN> supposedly if you force vsync it will be better
11P6:45:03 <DBN> but that doesn't work for me
P6:45:08 <AnnihilatorBeta> minecraft suddenly becomes unstable.
P6:47:01 <Siiseli> hit it
P6:47:12 <PuyoDead> yea, no luck Natural
P6:47:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> Awww :(
11P6:47:18 <DBN> hit it with a freeze pop
P6:47:24 <AlLnAtuRalX> Worked for clearbrook ://
P6:47:33 <PuyoDead> lemmie try FF 3
P6:47:49 <Snowman> You just lost the game
P6:47:55 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fuck you
P6:48:00 <Snowman> :D
11P6:48:00 <DBN> i just won the antigame
P6:48:02 <Maulrus> wait what is vsync?
P6:48:08 <Maulrus> is it ever enabled by default?
11P6:48:28 <DBN> vsync means it forces the framerate to be no higher than the monitor refresh rate
11P6:48:35 <DBN> usually not enabled by default
13P6:49:27 * Obnubulation thinks there should be some kind of allow-only user list to servers
11P6:49:35 <DBN> the nvidia software has an option to force it on
11P6:49:40 <DBN> idk about other cards
P6:50:37 <AlLnAtuRalX> I think ATI does also
P6:50:54 <PuyoDead> FF3 didn't like it either
P6:50:58 <PuyoDead> oh well, sucks
P6:51:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup :(
P6:51:09 <Testvan> ati has it inthe catalyst control ceneter
P6:51:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> yup
P6:51:29 <AlLnAtuRalX> it's there
P6:51:48 <AlLnAtuRalX> Fullscreen minecraft is amazing

P6:54:35 <Siiseli> what
P6:54:43 <Siiseli> minecrafts graphics are so great right now
P6:54:53 <Siiseli> if he changes them I'll be mad
P6:54:56 <Siiseli> damn you graphic whores
P6:54:56 <Testvan> where can i look up what a normal temperature range is for my processor?
P6:55:06 <Siiseli> Testvan, google, I'm quessing
P6:55:09 <AlLnAtuRalX> anything above 120 is not
P6:55:23 <Rroff> what CPU and what temp is it now?
P6:55:40 <Siiseli> if you see smoke coming from your computer then it's too hot
P6:55:42 <Testvan> its 45c during idle and like 69 when minecrafting
11P6:55:43 <DBN> water like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uofWfXOzX-g
P6:55:44 <Rroff> :P
P6:55:52 <Obnubulation> 120 degrees c or f?
P6:56:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> f obviously
P6:56:06 <Obnubulation> Gotta be c then
P6:56:16 <AlLnAtuRalX> 120c?  it would melt!
P6:56:27 <AlLnAtuRalX> that's way above boiling point
P6:56:28 <Siiseli> I'm quessing that was the whole point AlLnAtuRalX 
P6:56:35 <Testvan> 120f isnt very hot
P6:56:36 <Siiseli> and what
P6:56:37 <Obnubulation> Duh, I should have thought before I keyed
P6:56:41 <Rroff> most intel CPUs have nominal operating temps upto 70-75C
11P6:56:43 <DBN> generally you don't want your chips going above 90
P6:56:47 <Rroff> tho personally I like to keep mine below 60
P6:56:48 <Maulrus> guys, what does verify-names do?
P6:56:53 <Maulrus> in server.properties
P6:57:03 <Siiseli> AlLnAtuRalX, above boiling point of what
P6:57:06 <Siiseli> water?
P6:57:13 <Rroff> running a CPU at 90C will knock 40% off its lifespan
P6:57:20 <Testvan> my graphics card under full load will run 105c and thats in it's normal range
P6:57:28 <Rroff> uh
P6:57:29 <Siiseli> 40 percent 40 schmercent
P6:57:39 <Rroff> most GPUs throttle at 100-105Cish
P6:57:44 <Siiseli> mine is at about 80, graphic card that is
11P6:57:55 <DBN> 39% of all statistics are made up on the spot etc
P6:57:56 <Rroff> 80 is normal range for a GPU
P6:58:20 <Testvan> i plan to build a new computer during christmas so i dont care about longevity too much
P6:58:27 <Rroff> heh
P6:58:45 <Testvan> and that one will have proper cooling
P6:58:48 <Rroff> most components will outlive their useful lifespawn twice over even running above what they should
P6:58:55 <Testvan> this one was build in a frantic hurry when my last one exploded
P6:59:03 <Rroff> I Wonder why :P
P6:59:20 <Testvan> ya so this time i have learned my lesson
P6:59:25 <Siiseli> yay @ technology inflation thing
P7:00:07 <Rroff> heh
P7:00:37 <Rroff> nice thing is atm you can build a beast of a PC for almost nothing
P7:00:41 <Testvan> ya i built this computer for $600 and it was like 4 times faster than the one before it
11P7:01:44 <DBN> i don't build new pcs, i just upgrade continuously
P7:02:05 <AlLnAtuRalX> What's the line between upgrading and making a new PC but carrying over parts?
P7:02:18 <Testvan> ha minecraft just froze after 20 seconds of play
11P7:02:23 <DBN> probably motherboard replacement

P7:02:52 <Testvan> give me notch's phone number
11P7:02:58 <DBN> i still have a minecraft window open on my server from before the update :3
P7:03:18 <Testvan> ballin
P7:03:49 <Rroff> thats what you get for programming in java :(
11P7:04:28 <DBN> that's what he gets for making an update at the edge of sleep
P7:04:41 <Rroff> I'm still puzzled how it can cause the system timer to run fast
P7:06:05 <Rroff> surely you have to be poking directly into memory to cause that
P7:06:59 <Testvan> notch should know he always breaks something
P7:08:57 <Rroff> unless
P7:09:19 <Rroff> hes over-riding the system time with NTP updates to try and prevent speed hacks, etc.
P7:09:26 <Rroff> which is an extremely bad thing to do
11P7:09:47 <DBN> he does serverside antispeedhack
11P7:10:10 <DBN> cus when you're speedhacking you send packets more often

11P7:12:15 <DBN> yea the server is way too trusting
P7:12:47 <Rroff> tho I guess with minecraft its a bit different from most fps type games
11P7:13:13 <DBN> don't really see how
P7:13:14 <PuyoDead> hey Natural, does the greasemonkey icon change or anything when it's supposed to be doing something?
P7:13:26 <Rroff> well you can get away with much bigger gaps between updates
P7:13:36 <Rroff> you don't need as precise prediction
P7:13:40 <Inschato> Dynamic collision detection? Most other FPSes don't have the actual world changing, one exception might be Red Faction.. :P

P7:15:10 <Siiseli> right after circle collisions
P7:15:16 <Siiseli> well, in 3d maybe
P7:15:28 <liq3> Sphere collisions. :p
P7:15:41 <Siiseli> yeah well I'm talking about 2d here
P7:15:42 <liq3> But sphere collisions are really just 1d AABB collisions.
P7:15:45 <Rroff> tho its not actually sphere

P7:34:26 <AnnihilatorBeta> yes, but you probably won't like them anyways.
P7:34:27 <Quatroking> I dunno

P7:34:32 <Maulrus> gogo
P7:34:37 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'd say sid metal but you said they smell funny.
P7:34:56 <Quatroking> meh I don't like that stuff
P7:34:59 <Rroff> ah well I'm intro trance so I'm guessing my suggestoins wouldn't fly
P7:35:09 <AnnihilatorBeta> i'll give you a sample.

P8:46:06 <vdgmprgrmr> Arf, obviously not the very beginning.
P8:46:09 <Kinhoshi> lol Arf
P8:46:14 <Arf> It's a joke, vdgmprgrmr
P8:46:15 <Maulrus> BACK WHEN WE FLOODED CAVES, THEY STAYED FLOODED

P8:46:46 <Arf> I'll never have fancy clothes
P8:46:51 <Arf> since I can't buy minecraft :)

P8:47:22 <Kinhoshi> I actually spent hours removing water from flooded caves block by block. :P
P8:47:32 <Kinhoshi> Only to see that cavern flooded again in minutes
P8:47:38 <Maulrus> minutes?
P8:47:40 <Maulrus> try seconds
P8:47:45 <Maulrus> 100x100x3 room
P8:47:46 <Quatroking> I've automated most of the stuff on the mainpage now
P8:47:47 <Maulrus> of water
P8:47:50 <Maulrus> one water block
P8:47:58 <Kinhoshi> Well, I only played on a private server til recently.
P8:47:58 <Maulrus> that we missed while filling it in
P8:47:59 <Quatroking> I just enter a couple of parameters and the rest gets generated
P8:48:05 <Maulrus> = loads of OHHHHHHHHHH GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
P8:48:10 <vdgmprgrmr> I actually spent hours wishing water existed.
