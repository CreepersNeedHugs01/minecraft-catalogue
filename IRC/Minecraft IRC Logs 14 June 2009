Session Ident: #minecraft
A12:00:01 <paul|not> that's roughly the price of a nintendo DS game
A12:00:04 <ShadowAddict> I knew AD sounded wrong
A12:00:05 <Syniphas> [01:32] <Syniphas> Look, for comparison, full computer games (let's say the sims 2 + an expansion) go about $70 here
A12:00:08 <Syniphas> [01:33] <Syniphas> I don't see myself paying R$60 (full price) for a game like Minecraft
A12:00:25 <ShadowAddict> I see that
A12:00:28 <ShadowAddict> I wasn't arguing you
A12:00:30 <checkers> ATitD?
A12:00:43 <Parthon> a tale in the desert
A12:01:10 <prakCurie> A Tale in the Desert.  Don't even bother looking.
A12:01:22 <prakCurie> Er, right.  That.
A12:01:28 <Parthon> it's one of those games that looks promising, and ends up being a let down?
A12:01:43 <prakCurie> Let down doesn't even begin to describe the awfulness of it.
A12:02:28 <ShadowAddict> that sucks
A12:02:31 <prakCurie> I cannot describe how terrible the interface is.
A12:02:37 <Eagle> Spore.
A12:02:40 <ShadowAddict> more than so much
A12:02:43 <Parthon> I think you just did :P
A12:02:46 <ShadowAddict> spore was deceiving
A12:02:56 <ShadowAddict> when I first played it I was like "wow this is awesome"
A12:03:01 <ShadowAddict> then the creature stage got boring
A12:03:13 <ShadowAddict> but I was like "okay well the other stages will be awesome"
A12:03:14 <Eagle> I followed spore for 3 years. ;-;
A12:03:19 <ShadowAddict> tribal stage was okay
A12:03:20 <Eagle> Back when there was blood.
A12:03:25 <checkers> that is "deceiving"? I thought that was just the sign of an average game
A12:03:26 <ShadowAddict> civ stage was okay
A12:03:27 <Eagle> And no hugs.
A12:03:28 <downer> micro managing in the space stage is what killed spore for me
A12:03:32 <ShadowAddict> bam: space stage
A12:03:38 <ShadowAddict> i was like "oh my god so much to do"
A12:03:44 <Eagle> But there wasn't.
A12:03:50 <ShadowAddict> then twenty minutes later I stopped playing and never played it ever again
A12:03:59 <Eagle> I'm just lucky that I got it for free.
A12:04:07 <ShadowAddict> I didn't follow it til it was released so I didn't feel too let down
A12:04:12 <ShadowAddict> I got it for free too
A12:04:14 <Eagle> I felt incredibly let down.
A12:04:18 <ShadowAddict> I was very glad
A12:04:19 <Eagle> I didn't yarr it though.
A12:04:26 <Eagle> I won it in a contest.
A12:04:27 <downer> I enjoyed terra forming and stuff, but then all of my colonies, allies, and enemies bugged the shit out of me
A12:04:37 <ShadowAddict> Terra-forming was the only redeeming part of space stage
A12:04:47 <ShadowAddict> getting insta-raped constantly by enemies? nsm
A12:04:48 <Eagle> Terra-forming was terrible.
A12:05:21 <prakCurie> In any case, I'm hoping that Wurm kept getting worse because Notch left.  I'm paying for the dream that he is remaking it as intended.  (Just slightly more square.)
A12:05:24 <Eagle> Back when I first started following it you could actually /control where your retarded lakes and mountains go/
A12:05:24 <paul|not> never played spore
A12:05:45 <Syniphas> I guess we're not mising much.
A12:05:57 <Eagle> but in the official release you shoot a missle and hope that the lake doesn't split off into your city or mountain
A12:06:27 <Eagle> and hope that it is as big as you wanted it to be
A12:06:34 <Eagle> and in the place you aimed
A12:07:24 <Eagle> So anyways.
A12:08:00 <prakCurie> At what price would you say Spore might be worth trying?
A12:08:08 <Eagle> ?
A12:08:15 <Eagle> What do you mean by "price"
A12:08:54 <prakCurie> Can I get five dollars of fun out it?
A12:09:00 <ShadowAddict> I would say it is worth trying if you can get it for free and don't mind wasting space
12A12:09:00 * paul|not (grif392@adsl-71-142-210-210.dsl.scrm01.pacbell.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
A12:09:02 <ShadowAddict> ehhh
A12:09:03 <Eagle> For maybe five minutes.
A12:09:12 <ShadowAddict> if five dollars of fun = a day of fun at the most
A12:09:13 <ShadowAddict> then yes
A12:09:20 <ShadowAddict> by a day I mean five hours or so
A12:09:56 <Eagle> Five hours of sorta fun and then 3 days of remembering that you could have bought candy with that five dollars.
10A12:10:45 * paul|not (grif392@adsl-71-142-253-209.dsl.scrm01.pacbell.net) has joined #minecraft
A12:11:07 <prakCurie> I think that is about ten dollars going on the semi-decent movie metric.
A12:11:17 <ShadowAddict> well I personally did enjoy it for at about five horus
A12:11:35 <Eagle> Cell Phase was probably the funnest.
A12:11:47 <ShadowAddict> then about an hour of "am I having fun? this is kinda boring"
A12:11:49 <Eagle> Too bad it only lasts for about 10 minutes.
A12:11:50 <ShadowAddict> then never playing it again
A12:11:53 <Eagle> 2 mintues if on easy.
A12:11:59 <Eagle> *minutes
A12:12:01 <ShadowAddict> cell phase was awesome
A12:12:11 <ShadowAddict> civ phase took FOREVER for me cause I had religion
A12:12:16 <prakCurie> Bah, it hasn't dropped in price as much as I might have hoped.  Still at $40 on Steam.
A12:12:23 <ShadowAddict> it was far too easy with military
A12:12:25 <ShadowAddict> 40? ew
A12:12:55 <prakCurie> I know.  I thought it had bombed enough that it would be in the dollar bin at this point.
A12:12:59 <Eagle> ShadowAddict, the game used to have chase scenes and blood in creature phase.
A12:13:10 <Eagle> Now it has turn based battles and hugs.
A12:13:13 <ShadowAddict> before they made it cartoony?
A12:13:15 <ShadowAddict> XD
A12:13:17 <Eagle> Something went wrong somewhere.
A12:13:20 <ShadowAddict> yes
A12:13:25 <ShadowAddict> also some little things
A12:13:37 <ShadowAddict> like the fact that, when you evolved your creature, ALL of them changed
A12:13:40 <ShadowAddict> even though it made no sense
A12:13:44 <Eagle> Haha
A12:13:45 <prakCurie> I'm sorry.  What?  Turned based battles?
A12:13:50 <Eagle> Yup.
A12:13:56 <ShadowAddict> also that creatures that were yours in different nests didn't evolve seperately from you
A12:13:58 <ShadowAddict> stuff like that
A12:14:02 <ShadowAddict> yeah turn-based
A12:14:05 <Eagle> More like FFIV turn based
A12:14:25 <ShadowAddict> the kind of turn-based that seems real-time but isn't
A12:14:25 <Eagle> wait for your bite attack to recharge, attack, wait for the opponent's bite attack recharges
A12:14:32 <prakCurie> There had better be some sort of Easter egg giant gun sword or something in there.
A12:14:33 <Eagle> *to recharge
A12:15:17 <Eagle> I remember that when you dropped an animal on a moon in the original game, it would explode in a mist of blood
A12:15:27 <Eagle> Now it doesn't even let /you/ go down onto moons.
A12:15:41 <prakCurie> Screw it.  NS2 might actually make it out.  They can't possibly let me down.
A12:16:22 <Eagle> Oh and the cells in the cell phase have eyeballs and make squeaky noises.
A12:16:33 <ShadowAddict> anyone seen that project natal thing?
A12:16:51 <ShadowAddict> I can't wait to see how much of a disappointment that turns out to be
A12:17:01 <prakCurie> But but but.. didn't they have the moon death in one of their trailer things?
A12:17:33 <ShadowAddict> Not in the game
A12:17:56 <Eagle> There is no death in spore really.
A12:18:08 <Eagle> Except for the creature phase. >>
A12:18:18 <Eagle> But even then it's all sparkly when they die.
A12:19:31 <ShadowAddict> yeah it's stupid
A12:19:57 <prakCurie> Screw motion capture: http://emotiv.com/INDS_3/inds_3.html
A12:19:58 <Stargoat> so much potential
A12:20:00 <Stargoat> bleargh
A12:20:17 <ShadowAddict> games like spore helped me lose my faith in non-indie games
10A12:20:24 * paul|2 (grif392@adsl-71-142-213-58.dsl.scrm01.pacbell.net) has joined #minecraft

10A12:20:43 * paul|2 is now known as paul|not
A12:21:41 <prakCurie> Finding out that Wurm and ATitD didn't bothering paying their developers made me lose faith in indie game management.
A12:21:57 <prakCurie> Or at least the ones I seem to end up giving money to.
A12:23:08 <ShadowAddict> MMOs are impossible for me
A12:23:13 <ShadowAddict> I loved M&B though
A12:23:23 <ShadowAddict> I mean that's not an MMO 
A12:23:42 <ShadowAddict> but M&B was good before they screwed it up for the official release
A12:23:58 <ShadowAddict> gigantic 100v100 battles on horseback were fucking amazing
A12:24:27 <ShadowAddict> unless you had the disadvantage and ended up fighting 30 khans on horseback by yourself
A12:25:49 <ShadowAddict> I guess nobody on here ever played M&B >_>
A12:26:34 <prakCurie> I feel the need to be paranoid about someone coming along and smashing my stuff to be amused.
A12:27:12 <ShadowAddict> There was a terrifying phase of my life where I was addicted to Runescape for about three months
A12:27:27 <ShadowAddict> It came fairly close to ruining my life
A12:27:41 <ShadowAddict> I didn't lose my friends but that was cause all my friends played it too >_>
A12:27:47 <ShadowAddict> my grades plummeted though
A12:27:58 <prakCurie> I think I looked at it once while searching for a new game I could dig but I can't say I ever bothered to download it.
A12:28:17 <ShadowAddict> Runescape?
A12:28:33 <ShadowAddict> or M&B
A12:29:51 <prakCurie> M&B.  I get my kicks off of Runescape by listening to other people talk about how much better their game/community is since it isn't Runescape.
A12:30:28 <prakCurie> So I can't play it in case so I can always pretend they are fooling themselves.
A12:30:45 <prakCurie> er.. in case they are right... something something.
A12:31:01 <prakCurie> Same with WoW.
A12:31:18 <ShadowAddict> RS community is terrifying
A12:31:37 <ShadowAddict> M&B was awesome though
A12:32:12 <ShadowAddict> hm
A12:32:20 <ShadowAddict> I found a glacier with a magma pipe
A12:32:33 <prakCurie> ?
A12:32:35 <ShadowAddict> I'm way too much of a noob to pull off a glacier fortress though >_>
A12:32:36 <ShadowAddict> DF
A12:32:42 <Arf> so MSPaint adventures just totally got playable
A12:32:44 <prakCurie> Ah.
A12:32:57 <prakCurie> I keep meaning to play that.
A12:34:43 <ShadowAddict> kinda interesting
A12:35:22 <Drakkar> <ShadowAddict> I'm way too much of a noob to pull off a glacier fortress though >_>
A12:35:27 <Drakkar> gonna probably do one later this week
A12:35:33 <Drakkar> after I do gilligan's isle
A12:37:14 <ShadowAddict> Hell, I can't even hold together a perfect mountain fortress

A1:19:36 <ShadowAddict> holy shit
A1:19:45 <Drakkar> its horribly cheesy though
A1:19:48 <ShadowAddict> there was apparently a battle between 449 elves and 21 humans
A1:19:50 <zaqu> so what has been put in since alpha16.02?
A1:19:53 <Drakkar> and funny
A1:19:54 <ShadowAddict> the humans lost, but they took out 199 elves

A1:24:05 <Drakkar> lmao
A1:24:07 <ShadowAddict> I got one fey, which failed
A1:24:08 <Parthon> aaah right
A1:24:13 <ShadowAddict> and one fell, which pissed me off
A1:24:15 <Drakkar> fell is ok too though
A1:24:18 <Drakkar> because fell is fun to watch
A1:24:19 <Drakkar> >_>
A1:24:19 <Drakkar> <_<
A1:24:26 <Parthon> hehe .. possession is fine too
A1:24:29 <ShadowAddict> I didn't know what was going on, so when he killed my only metalsmith I was like "OH COME ON MANG"
A1:24:41 <ShadowAddict> possession doesn't give you a legendary skill though :c
A1:24:55 <Parthon> I know, but then you sell the artifact
A1:25:05 <Drakkar> I haven't been able to trade any artifacts
A1:25:06 <Drakkar> its weird
A1:25:21 <Eagle> My dwarves make retarded artifacts.
A1:25:27 <Drakkar> not that it matters too much
A1:25:29 <Drakkar> I farm anvils
A1:25:37 <ShadowAddict> I remember my first ever artifact
A1:25:40 <ShadowAddict> I was so excited
A1:25:54 <Drakkar> mine is a rhyolite bed for this fortress
A1:25:59 <ShadowAddict> and then I got pissed when he made a barrel with A CARVING OF A BARREL ON IT
A1:26:01 <Drakkar> second is a bar/block bin
A1:26:02 <Parthon> farm anvils?
A1:26:04 <ShadowAddict> I was like "WHAT THE HELL SERIOUSLY"
A1:26:08 <Drakkar> 3rd is a clear zircon earring
A1:26:09 <Drakkar> yeah
A1:26:11 <Eagle> My first artifact was a SKULL THRONE
A1:26:14 <Drakkar> because they're worth 1k
A1:26:17 <Drakkar> they're prime trade goods
A1:26:23 <Parthon> ShadowAddict: lol .. that's some metaphysical shit right there
A1:26:27 <Drakkar> I have so much hematite it comes out my ears
A1:26:34 <Parthon> aaah
A1:26:34 <Drakkar> so I have no problem getting iron
A1:26:40 <ShadowAddict> I have weird luck with artifacts
A1:26:53 <ShadowAddict> I had a perfect site a little while ago
A1:26:55 <Drakkar> I love my engraver though
A1:26:57 <Drakkar> he uh
A1:27:05 <Drakkar> engraves dwarves laughing at the mayors
A1:27:06 <ShadowAddict> flux, magma, underground river, bauxite, no evil, no aquifer
A1:27:23 <ShadowAddict> but everyone killed themselves
A1:27:28 <ShadowAddict> :c
10A1:27:55 * Krynvelhat (chatzilla@202.164.196.185) has joined #minecraft
A1:28:00 <Parthon> rofl!
A1:28:01 <Parthon> fail
A1:28:18 <ShadowAddict> well 20 people killed themselves
A1:28:29 <Parthon> I pick areas which are 100% evil, dangerous, chasm, bauxite etc etc
A1:28:29 <ShadowAddict> I pulled a boatmurdered on the last 20 and flooded them with magma
A1:28:38 <ShadowAddict> I don't because I'm not good
A1:28:38 <Parthon> and all my dwarves end up fine :(
A1:28:40 <ShadowAddict> at all
A1:28:47 <ShadowAddict> and I still suck
A1:29:21 <Parthon> the only time I've actually severely failed is when I started in a massive chasm, and got killed with a month by batmen
A1:30:02 <ShadowAddict> There was the lulzy time when unicorns raped me hard
A1:30:23 <ShadowAddict> I was so excited to have unicorns because I thought they would fight for me
A1:30:24 <ShadowAddict> >_>
A1:30:43 <Drakkar> I love evil
A1:30:44 <Drakkar> danger
A1:30:46 <ShadowAddict> and of course the two of my fortresses that got carp-raped
A1:30:51 <Drakkar> but chasms just annoy the hell out of me
A1:30:52 <paul|not> lol
A1:30:55 <paul|not> carps are always
A1:30:56 <paul|not> terrible
A1:31:07 <ShadowAddict> I thought people were joking when they said "oh god you have carp? RUN"
A1:31:10 <Drakkar> I make sure I don't have chasms or bottomless pits because they're really just a mapsore
A1:31:10 <ShadowAddict> then I looked it up
A1:31:12 <ShadowAddict> and weeped
A1:31:12 <checkers> damn, now I want to play again
A1:31:19 <Drakkar> and a waste of space
A1:31:20 <paul|not> DWARF CANCELS LIFE: INTERRUPTED BY CARP
A1:31:20 <Drakkar> :(
A1:31:21 <ShadowAddict> why are chasms so bad?
A1:31:22 <Drakkar> rofl
A1:31:22 <Drakkar> XD
A1:31:25 <Drakkar> they're just
A1:31:26 <Drakkar> big
A1:31:27 <Drakkar> fucking
A1:31:28 <Drakkar> holes
A1:31:30 <Drakkar> full of monsters
A1:31:35 <ShadowAddict> ah
A1:31:38 <checkers> that's why they are fun
A1:31:41 <Drakkar> I have no problem with the monster part
A1:31:47 <Drakkar> but they take up alot of space on the region
A1:31:52 <Drakkar> which makes me a sadface
A1:32:01 <ShadowAddict> Why the fuck do my wrestlers feel the need to strip while they manhandle each other
A1:32:02 <paul|not> so what would prevent you from making a sealed fortress that's self sufficient
A1:32:07 <paul|not> besides the eventual insanity of dwarves
A1:32:08 <ShadowAddict> not that there's anything wrong with that
A1:32:09 <Drakkar> onothing
A1:32:12 <checkers> wow, last released version dec 2008?!
A1:32:14 <Drakkar> nothing*
A1:32:16 <Drakkar> its actually doable
A1:32:24 <Drakkar> yeah a new version is coming (hopefully) soon
A1:32:35 <paul|not> best way to protect against invasion: don't HAVE a way in
A1:32:35 <Drakkar> he's working on revamping military control
A1:32:40 <Drakkar> I love ways in
A1:32:40 <ShadowAddict> I had an effectively sealed fortress at one point
A1:32:48 <Parthon> same
A1:32:51 <ShadowAddict> part of it was outside but it was walled him heavily
A1:32:53 <ShadowAddict> *in
A1:32:54 <Parthon> pull lever: bridge up
A1:32:54 <Drakkar> I do all my resources below ground too though
A1:32:56 <paul|not> magma fortresses are always fun
A1:33:09 <ShadowAddict> Magma fortresses make life so much easier
A1:33:09 <Drakkar> farming/tower cap groves
A1:33:10 <Drakkar> etc
A1:33:16 <ShadowAddict> because I don't have to waste all my wood on charcoal
A1:33:28 <ShadowAddict> also it makes for lulzy traps
A1:33:36 <paul|not> and lava moats are great
A1:33:50 <Drakkar> I'm currently drawing out a giant stadium
A1:34:00 <Drakkar> so my soldiers can be employed as gladiators occassionally
A1:34:19 <ShadowAddict> Though I had massive sadfaces when I told my dorf to carve out the channel to open the magma flow
A1:34:27 <Drakkar> rofl
A1:34:32 <ShadowAddict> but nobody had gotten around to building the floodgate yet
A1:34:38 <paul|not> lol
A1:34:38 <ShadowAddict> and it was on the top level
A1:34:43 <Parthon> bahaha
A1:34:45 <ShadowAddict> babies dying everywhere
A1:34:49 <Parthon> woot
A1:34:51 <paul|not> so I have a plan for a build in minecraft
A1:34:57 <paul|not> 64 tile wide sphere
A1:34:58 <Genisi> lava is the great "to hell with the world" tool
A1:35:06 <Parthon> worse is when it burns through your mechanism and breaks the floodgate
A1:35:51 <Genisi> I love trying to build floodgate doomsday weapons that unleash lava into the nearby hills
A1:36:17 <ShadowAddict> I'm generating a bunch of maps looking for a good magma spot
13A1:36:19 * Parthon stares at his code
A1:36:24 <Parthon> why wont' you write yourself?!?
A1:36:30 <Genisi> although I usually end up messing it up completely and it flows into my forts
A1:36:30 <paul|not> lazy code
A1:36:32 <paul|not> beat it up parthon
A1:36:54 <paul|not> I could never get super into DF
A1:36:58 <checkers> personally I think magma is essential to fun
A1:36:59 <paul|not> but it's definitely fun
A1:37:07 <Genisi> burning my entire population, save for one dwarf that's somewhere running off to get a drink
A1:37:50 <Genisi> I either just fail completely and boringly, losing my fort after a year, or survive long enough to spectaularily lose my fort somhow
A1:38:08 <paul|not> lol
A1:38:14 <paul|not> the spectacular losses are always great
A1:38:18 <Genisi> yeah
A1:38:53 <Drakkar> I managed to have all but one dwarf of a fortress die
A1:38:57 <Drakkar> and then have him thrive
A1:39:00 <Drakkar> it was pretty awkward
A1:39:01 <paul|not> lol
A1:39:02 <paul|not> hermit
A1:39:09 <Drakkar> it was like
A1:39:15 <Drakkar> 90 dwarves -> 1 dwarf
A1:39:21 <paul|not> hahahaha
A1:39:23 <Parthon> 1 superdwarf :D
A1:39:27 <Drakkar> I didn't continue it because I uh
A1:39:33 <Drakkar> couldn't do hermit how I'd like
A1:39:49 <Drakkar> once i can attack friendly units I'll do a hermit run
A1:39:49 <Drakkar> :D
A1:39:59 <paul|not> lol
A1:40:15 <Parthon> Drakkar: just drown them
A1:40:26 <Drakkar> more interested in going
A1:40:29 <Drakkar> GET OFF OF MY LAND
A1:40:39 <Drakkar> and then sniping them from a tower with a crossbow
A1:40:59 <paul|not> lol
A1:41:03 <Parthon> oh, you can do that to :D
A1:41:03 <paul|not> multiplayer survival goan be great
A1:41:04 <paul|not> :D
A1:41:19 <Drakkar> yeah
A1:41:20 <Drakkar> deffo
A1:41:21 <paul|not> I will be the hermit with a bomb shelter
A1:41:32 <ShadowAddict> Hm
A1:41:42 <ShadowAddict> Nist Akath is a lot more fun to read than Boatmurdered
A1:41:47 <paul|not> really
A1:41:49 <ShadowAddict> though Boatmurdered had its moments
A1:41:49 <paul|not> link it
A1:41:51 <Parthon> multiplayer dwarf fortress?
A1:41:53 <Drakkar> hook up
A1:42:03 <Parthon> clicky!
A1:42:05 <paul|not> Parthon: minecraft survival mode
A1:42:05 <mezo> is fps capped at 60 now?
A1:42:20 <Drakkar> I do intend to do something around the lines of traptastic with gilligan's isle though
A1:42:22 <ShadowAddict> http://www.bay12games.com/forum/index.php?topic=19279.0
A1:42:49 <paul|not> oh man if we can do traps
A1:42:50 <paul|not> :DD
A1:43:13 <ShadowAddict> "DF Lite" seems like it'd have traps
A1:44:18 <Parthon> paul|not: oh, I mean more like two people controlling the same fort at once :D
A1:44:21 <Parthon> assisting each other
A1:44:30 <paul|not> hah that'd be cool
A1:44:34 <Parthon> rather than *being* the working
A1:44:41 <ShadowAddict> I'm personally looking forward to zombie siege more than survival
A1:44:47 <ShadowAddict> though I know survival is gonna be amazing
A1:44:51 <paul|not> probably wouldn't be too hard to do some DF netcode
A1:45:17 <ShadowAddict> two people would make it a lot easier

A1:46:25 <Drakkar> I mean dwarves would be resistant to liver failure
A1:46:25 <Drakkar> but
A1:46:40 <Eagle> My fortresses usually end when a cat dies, and his owner kills himself.
A1:46:44 <Drakkar> it'd just be hilarious
A1:46:49 <Eagle> And his friends kill theirselves.
A1:47:24 <notjotham> my last fortress collapsed when a flaming baby ran into the great hall causing everyone to vomit and destroy legendary items causing the entire fort to cascade into oblivion

A1:49:06 <ShadowAddict> oh dammnit
A1:49:15 <Drakkar> that was amazing
A1:49:19 <ShadowAddict> perfect place but no flux
A1:49:27 <vdgmprgrmr> I think my monitor just magically got bigger by about fifty pixels.
A1:49:58 <Eagle> It's them swine flu's.
A1:50:01 <Eagle> Trust me.
A1:50:14 <Drakkar> ..
A1:50:16 <Drakkar> oh shit
A1:50:18 <Drakkar> cave adaptation
A1:50:26 <ShadowAddict> obsidian is a sure indication of magma, right?
A1:50:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Everything on my desktop (icons and such) is in the same place as normal, but now there's about fifty pixels of extra space at the bottom of it.
A1:50:30 <Drakkar> that is the only explanation
A1:50:31 <Eagle> What's so bad about cave adaptation anyways?
A1:50:32 <ShadowAddict> on the embark screen?
A1:50:32 <Drakkar> yeah
A1:50:35 <ShadowAddict> yayz
A1:50:35 <Drakkar> dwarves vomit
A1:50:41 <vdgmprgrmr> Between my icons and my task bar.
A1:50:43 <Drakkar> when they come in contact with the sun
A1:50:49 <Drakkar> generally yeah
A1:50:55 <vdgmprgrmr> And when I make something full screen, it doesn't go all the way down.
A1:50:56 <Eagle> Then delete the staircase or something.
A1:51:01 <vdgmprgrmr> It stops where my icons stop.
A1:51:22 <vdgmprgrmr> And you can see the desktop under it.
A1:51:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Even though it's full-screen.
A1:51:46 <Drakkar> my fortress is half above ground

A2:31:46 <mezo> 5th try
A2:31:54 <mezo> is anyone else fps capped at 60 or is it just me
A2:32:04 <Kira> one of my buddies is mezo
A2:32:11 <mezo> k
A2:32:14 <mezo> so its just a bad version
A2:32:15 <Kira> I'm not though
A2:32:20 <ShadowAddict> I'd try but I'm not on a a computer that goes above 20 so >_>
A2:32:28 <ShadowAddict> though 60 isn't choppy, why does it matter?
A2:32:30 <Kira> not sure what would cause that
A2:32:39 <mezo> it's not just regular 60 fps
A2:32:49 <mezo> its really choppy and mouse movement isnt tracked fully
A2:32:53 <Parthon> it's capped now
A2:32:54 <mezo> i find it unplayable
A2:33:26 <Kira> it's most definitely not capped

A4:06:28 <vdgmprgrmr> And in the corner on the other side of that one, you have nothing.
A4:06:35 <ShadowAddict> oh god my wrestlers are getting nude already
A4:06:39 <ShadowAddict> AND MORE MICROCLINE
A4:06:40 <ShadowAddict> WHEEEE
A4:06:41 <Fire> o.o
A4:06:51 <Fire> O.O
A4:06:55 <vdgmprgrmr> If you stand in the corner where ther is nothing and walk continuously into the corner toward the liquid, and press space, you will swim.
A4:07:03 <vdgmprgrmr> So like:
A4:07:07 <vdgmprgrmr> XL
A4:07:07 <ShadowAddict> cobaltite

A4:07:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Like:
A4:07:18 <Notch> oh, haha
A4:07:20 <vdgmprgrmr> XL
A4:07:22 <vdgmprgrmr> OX
A4:07:30 <vdgmprgrmr> And L is liquid and O is nothing.
A4:07:41 <Notch> got it, adding to bug list. thank you. =)
A4:07:54 <ShadowAddict> olivine
A4:08:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, for one that I just remembered, and is somewhat significant.
A4:08:03 <ShadowAddict> so many useless things
A4:08:14 <vdgmprgrmr> If you're in water, and you're in a situation like this:
A4:08:19 <vdgmprgrmr> 22
A4:08:23 <vdgmprgrmr> 1L
A4:08:53 <vdgmprgrmr> (Where numbers are the height of a solid, 1 being you-can-get-on-it, and 2 being one-block-too-high)
A4:09:26 <vdgmprgrmr> And you're in the liquid, and you try to move diagonally toward the center while pressing space, you can't get on the block like you should be able to.
A4:10:01 <vdgmprgrmr> You have to be almost looking at the center of the block that would be to the left of the 1-height-block to get on it.
A4:10:55 <vdgmprgrmr> And now for one that's pretty insignificant.
A4:11:35 <Fire> yes?
A4:11:51 <paul|not> "Murder?!" cried the Captain, "He killed a cat! Nobody even owned the cat! I'd ordered that cat butchered for our meat stockpiles!"
A4:12:00 <vdgmprgrmr> If you have two blocks of the same height diagonal from each other, but still adjacent, and there's one block above them in one corner, and you try to move over to the other block from the one at the same height, it will sometimes work.
A4:12:09 <vdgmprgrmr> It only works in one direction, though.
A4:12:27 <vdgmprgrmr> It works consistently in one direction, but as I've tested, no other direction.
A4:12:43 <Notch> that last one is probably a side effect of how I do the physics
A4:12:59 <Notch> i'm not sure if I'm going to fix that one. But the swimming bugs, I will
A4:13:05 <Notch> thank you for the reports. =)

A5:19:05 <vatsa> Notch, you should so some program to make easier to edit bitmaps for character skins, just like paint, but there should be also a charater where you can see the changes realtime

A5:20:04 <Haruhi2> so it's accessible for everyone

A5:21:54 <Haruhi2> be able to just write on walls by pixel
A5:22:54 <vdgmprgrmr> I don't like the skin database idea.
A5:23:24 <Haruhi2> why not
A5:23:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Could make for skin repeats.
A5:23:38 <vdgmprgrmr> It would make the skins less personal.
A5:23:39 <Haruhi2> hmm
A5:23:57 <Haruhi2> yeah i guess it'd kinda lead to people just copying
A5:24:10 <vdgmprgrmr> If Joe makes a skin of Awesome value 9000+ then more and more people will just use that skin.
A5:24:32 <vdgmprgrmr> (Yeah, it's over 9000.)
A5:24:56 <Haruhi2> also Notch what about a "look" key like K in dwarf fortress
A5:25:08 <Zolyx> a skin database would rock, yes. but not before Survival :)
A5:25:29 <Notch> what would it do?
A5:25:42 <Haruhi2> tell you what you're looking at
A5:25:46 <vdgmprgrmr> ...
A5:25:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Can you not tell?
A5:26:17 <Haruhi2> so you can toggle whether or not info text will pop up when you look at something
A5:27:15 <Haruhi2> maybe integrate it with engravings/signs so if you look at a sign with it on it'll tell you what it says

A5:46:45 <mib_xnf5q1hf> Notch, I just read your post about survival mode. Could you regain health from sleeping too?
A5:47:13 <Notch> maybe! it'd add a purpose for beds
A5:47:59 <Snowman> or maybe opening paint while playing minecraft would give you invincibility? :D
A5:48:07 <Haruhi2> also notch what about a jelly block
A5:48:16 <Haruhi2> water block that doesn't flood or fall
A5:48:28 <Cue> Bouncy!
A5:48:29 <Haruhi2> but isn't as easy to swim through
13A5:48:30 * Parthon smashes things
A5:48:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, Notch!
A5:48:51 <vdgmprgrmr> Survival mode goal!
A5:48:52 <Skonar> I want a cloth block to do pirate sails with.
A5:48:56 <vdgmprgrmr> Kill big evil mob!
A5:49:15 <vdgmprgrmr> A super-troll lives in a cave, and he is just terrible.
A5:49:24 <vdgmprgrmr> And you have to gather resources to kill it.
A5:49:31 <Snowman> i want maps without water :p
A5:49:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I want that one!
A5:50:07 <mib_xnf5q1hf> What about please?
A5:50:16 <vdgmprgrmr> ... Please?
A5:50:24 <Snowman> Pretty please with a mob on top?
A5:50:31 <vdgmprgrmr> Yep!
A5:50:54 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, wouldn't the monsters on the map either be way too overwhelming, or die out too quickly?
A5:51:04 <Snowman> respawning
A5:51:10 <Haruhi2> random sieges
A5:51:12 <Notch> repsawning :D
A5:51:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, but the respawning seems like it might be a bit obvious.
A5:51:38 <vdgmprgrmr> And I always saw respawning as something to be kept behind the curtain or so.
A5:51:53 <Snowman> they respawn at places when you dont look at it
A5:52:02 <Snowman> that could be a solution
A5:52:08 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah, but it'd still be obvious.
A5:52:16 <Snowman> ...
A5:52:18 <Skonar> Monsters could spawn new little monsters.
A5:52:20 <vdgmprgrmr> Unless you're on HUGE maps.
A5:52:20 <Snowman> you cant have everything
A5:52:23 <Skonar> And they could spring forth from their butt.
A5:52:28 <Snowman> lol

A5:52:32 <Skonar> LIKE A REAL ECOSYSTEM.
A5:52:32 <vdgmprgrmr> But yeah, respawning seems best.
A5:52:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, we will be able to place mobs in creative, correct?
A5:52:57 <vdgmprgrmr> To make cool dungeons?
A5:53:04 <mib_xnf5q1hf> notch could you add placing water to singleplayer?
A5:53:26 <mib_xnf5q1hf> except when you place the block it ask you Are you sure? Y/N
A5:53:34 <Snowman> and easier draining alltogether
A5:53:41 <vdgmprgrmr> (And of course, placing mobs in creative should mean that the mobs you place STAY put, perhaps in a sort of menacing, taunt animation. (battle-stance for goblins, perpetual growling for wolves, etc.))
A5:53:49 <mib_xnf5q1hf> Drain block, deletes water :)
A5:53:51 <Saladan0> A block itself that spawns water could be cool, so you could make a perpetual waterfall or something
A5:53:55 <Saladan0> would be great for decoration
A5:54:02 <Haruhi2> also what about multiple character models
A5:54:27 <Saladan0> How about vehicles?
A5:54:28 <Saladan0> cars
A5:54:28 <Snowman> yeah a block that sucks up all surrounding water woul be awesome
A5:54:30 <Saladan0> planes
A5:54:33 <Snowman> treverse flooding
A5:54:33 <Parthon> Saladan0: a block taht spawns water would be water :P
A5:54:38 <Saladan0> Oh yea
A5:54:41 <Snowman> lol
A5:54:43 <Kira> what would be cool would be breaking a single block up into like an 8x8 block, letting you make props like tables or beds or chairs or something. No idea how feasible that is though.
A5:54:48 <vdgmprgrmr> I think he means when we get finite water...
A5:54:56 <Snowman> kira that wont work
A5:55:02 <Snowman> too many blocks, too much map data
A5:55:06 <Haruhi2> like you could have the model that's here now or a fat model or a more girly model i guess
A5:55:06 <Parthon> not on Notch's design though
A5:55:14 <Saladan0> Comuters would explode
A5:55:18 <Parthon> Snowman: I'm using that design as a basis for space fortress :P
A5:55:30 <Snowman> what design?
A5:55:32 <Kira> most likely, but it wouldn't be every block
A5:55:38 <Haruhi2> or a model with a big beard
A5:55:42 <Parthon> blocks which can be split into smaller blocks
A5:55:45 <Snowman> oh
A5:55:49 <Haruhi2> so you can play as a dwarf
A5:56:00 <Saladan0> A noclip mode for admin would be handy, or a teleport option
A5:56:04 <Snowman> my model has a beard atm
A5:56:08 <Snowman> well, a goatee
A5:56:09 <Fire> wow
A5:56:20 <Fire> hosting a server uses bulk download
A5:56:27 <mib_xnf5q1hf> but noclip takes away the challenge
A5:56:31 <Fire> like 400 up and down for 3 hours
A5:56:37 <Saladan0> I mean for admin use
A5:56:41 <Fire> Megabytes
A5:56:42 <Kira> Parthon- is that what notch is going to do or something?
A5:56:43 <Saladan0> as in, going to a problem person
A5:56:46 <Saladan0> seeing what they are doing
A5:57:02 <Saladan0> Usaully you here in chat, "Hey, so and so is deleting stuff"

A5:58:12 <Notch> no, the other way around
A5:58:13 <mezo> does the game recognize who you're pointing at yet?
A5:58:18 <mezo> so you could bind a key to teleport
A5:58:20 <citricsquid> oh, awesome.
A5:58:38 <Deiz> Notch: Tab completion on names would be highly useful
A5:58:45 <Saladan0> BUt if you can see someone, why would you need to telport to him?
A5:58:57 <Haruhi2> actually notch what about seperating head mesh from body mesh and giving a choice for head shape
A5:59:04 <Haruhi2> or something
A5:59:14 <Snowman> square head is good for me
A5:59:32 <mezo> i dont actually think teleporting shoud be in, but there are tons of exampels Saladan0
A5:59:52 <vdgmprgrmr> Haha! I like how on the blog you say "Made the font to differentiate between I and l." and they both look exaxtly the same in the blog's font.
A5:59:57 <Snowman> only teleporting to players should be in, not to other places
A6:00:03 <vdgmprgrmr> Exactly.

A6:14:23 <iPope> don't know if its possible
A6:16:14 <citricsquid> My favourite idea is trap blocks, look like normal blocks but when you step on them you fall through, would be fun for lava and water, limited number per map/world.

A6:18:08 <mezo> yea void block without finite water does nothing
A6:18:28 <iPope> I dont understand

A6:19:45 <Haruhi2> sponge block that soaks up water
A6:19:47 <vdgmprgrmr> And the infinite water just makes more water next to it.
A6:19:56 <Haruhi2> deleting it releases the water it has stored
A6:20:00 <vdgmprgrmr> (at iPope.)
A6:20:12 <iPope> I didn't think of that :(
A6:20:21 <iPope> It would just do bugger all
A6:20:31 <iPope> apart from slide flowing water
A6:20:36 <iPope> side*
A6:20:59 <iPope> but thats the same as a wall :(
A6:21:10 <Snowman> a sponge blocks should just sucks up all the water on that height
A6:21:50 <Notch> that would make them far too powerful
A6:21:54 <Notch> you could drain entire oceans

10A6:22:41 * smn`offline is now known as smn

A6:25:00 <DeathsBrother> EDITOR
A6:25:08 <Snowman> say please
A6:25:15 <DeathsBrother> Please is for the weak.
A6:25:19 <DeathsBrother> I DEMAND it.
A6:25:21 <Snowman> yay you said it
A6:25:26 <vdgmprgrmr> Yeah Notch, we really need a level editor.
A6:25:31 <Skeep> be patiant, hes got more fun stuff to work on
A6:25:38 <citricsquid> like shopping!
A6:25:46 <Snowman> tbh, minecraft is a level editor on itself :p
A6:25:56 <DeathsBrother> Yeah.
A6:25:56 <vdgmprgrmr> (I was being sarcastic.)
A6:25:57 <DeathsBrother> But it
A6:25:58 <DeathsBrother> Takes
A6:25:59 <DeathsBrother> For like
A6:26:00 <DeathsBrother> ever.
A6:26:01 <DeathsBrother> Srs.
A6:26:07 <Snowman> you
A6:26:08 <Snowman> know
A6:26:08 <Snowman> you
A6:26:10 <Snowman> couldve
A6:26:12 <Skeep> all it needs is a fly mode and BAM theres the level editor
A6:26:14 <Snowman> pu
A6:26:14 <vdgmprgrmr> DeathsBrother, the building and such are the FUN PART.
A6:26:15 <DeathsBrother> A level editor for making custom terrains.
A6:26:19 <Snowman> that in one
A6:26:21 <DeathsBrother> Like custom generators, and such.
A6:26:21 <Snowman> message
A6:26:30 <DeathsBrother> It would be much easier than hex editing the level.
A6:26:35 <vdgmprgrmr> level-generator parameters would be very nice!
A6:26:47 <DeathsBrother> Very.
A6:26:51 <Snowman> yeah like no water
A6:27:03 <peerkoel> btw, drain block that drains all water is no problem, there's an infinite water supply at the edges, the ocean
A6:27:14 <citricsquid> If it wasn't too complicated, something like % of water, % of lava and % of each blocks and it randomises where they're placed?
A6:27:14 <Snowman> yeah i know
A6:27:22 <doohan> Skinning is cool
A6:27:37 <Snowman> doohan what skin you made?

A6:27:46 <Haruhi2> however
A6:27:52 <Skeep> I was surpised at how small the skining sorce images are
A6:27:53 <Haruhi2> drain blocks could crash the server if placed in oceans
A6:28:13 <peerkoel> nah

A6:30:22 <vdgmprgrmr> For a naturally occurring one, it is.
A6:30:38 <Skeep> if anyone isn't sure on whats what in the skinning templale I made a diagram if anyones interested, althouth its pritty simple to begin with so not that nessisary

A7:04:39 <Skonar> More general failures will occur as Notch dampens.
A7:04:51 <Haruhi2> speaking of wet
A7:05:14 <Haruhi2> blocks should change color to show that they're wet so you can avoid mining them out
A7:05:33 <Notch> yeah, I like that idea. =)
A7:05:57 <Notch> it both looks nice, is (fairly) easy to do, and has a huge impact on usability
A7:06:02 <Haruhi2> also on the hardest difficulty hot blocks and wet blocks don't look different from normal blocks

A7:07:38 <Haruhi2> make it a normal link

A7:07:56 <Notch> i'll move it to about somewhere, how about that?
A7:08:00 <ZomBuster> put it on your blog instead of the minecraft page?

A7:08:08 <Skonar> How does one make screenshots, anyway? Printscreen?

A7:09:14 <vdgmprgrmr> If you are swimming up against a wall in lava, and you're on the surface, and there is a wall below the wall you're colliding with (that is, there's no lava below the wall) using the left arrow key, and you're facing away from the wall at about a 30-degree angle, you will jump up each time you reach the peak of your swimmingness.
A7:09:16 <Notch> yes, Snowman =D
A7:09:16 <Deiz> AFAIK the applet operates in a sandbox
A7:09:19 <Parthon> Notch: why would it bother people?
A7:09:21 <DeathsBrother> We should have a level editor, or something that  adjusts what would be generated in levels.
A7:09:23 <Notch> that was before prepurchasing, though
A7:09:25 <Deiz> So it'd not be able to write a screenshot to disk
A7:09:32 <Snowman> i know
A7:09:35 <Notch> Parthon: Getting bugged about money after having paid..
A7:09:43 <zid> java can write files deiz
A7:09:44 <Notch> it'd bother me
A7:09:45 <Snowman> now you made like 1500 euros already :p
A7:09:58 <Parthon> Notch: I say, load minecraft, build a bridge and get over it :P
A7:10:03 <citricsquid> It's possible to get inside blocks, if you go into some water and above you is lava and remove the blocks then swim into the lava the lava and water colide forming a block and you're inside the block.
A7:10:04 <Notch> hehe
A7:10:18 <zid> well that's a client bug
A7:10:22 <DeathsBrother> We have a better means of doing that citric.
A7:10:25 <DeathsBrother> Its called noclip.
A7:10:35 <Haruhi2> water and lava really should make obsidian so it's unique

A7:12:27 <Skonar> I now have one 20 blocks high and 27 wide.
A7:12:29 <Notch> oh, still? I thought I had fixed that in the latest server software
A7:12:29 <Parthon> DeathsBrother: it's a feature
A7:12:31 <DeathsBrother> theres like ?     ?      ?     ?     ? then the regular name
A7:12:35 <Skonar> IT IS VISIBLE FROM SPACE.
A7:12:37 <Notch> I'll investigate, DeathsBrother. =)
A7:12:41 <DeathsBrother> You fixed sending message packets.

A7:12:44 <DeathsBrother> At random
A7:12:57 <Parthon> Notch: sanitise names?
A7:12:58 <DeathsBrother> And it annoys the hell out of it, since its starting to happen alot on my server.

A7:31:50 <Parthon> C418: OMFG! YOU ARE A GENIOUS!
A7:31:51 <iPope> haha mezo is on the blog
A7:31:51 <C418> I think he is noclip too
A7:31:55 <DeathsBrother> Whenever I do a /banip
A7:31:56 <DeathsBrother> the ip
A7:31:58 <zid> of course it is, it's not a client
A7:32:02 <C418> eh?
A7:32:05 <mezo> nice
A7:32:05 <DeathsBrother> Isnt banned
A7:32:05 <zid> it's a bot
A7:32:09 <DeathsBrother> Its not in the .txt file
A7:32:16 <Gauphastus> Quite a list of banned IPs I'm collecting.
A7:32:20 <citricsquid> Is the text file writable?
A7:32:23 <mezo> ive been on the devblog 3 times, i am winning
A7:32:37 <Parthon> Notch: does the level data always start at the same position in the file?
A7:32:46 <Notch> no guarantees, Parthon
A7:33:08 <Parthon> I mean, is it fixed per-version, or is it variable?
A7:33:11 <iPope> Notch what did you buy :P
A7:33:21 <zid> how come the world is 64KiB but the server sends me 128k when I connect?
A7:33:23 <Notch> i can make no guarantees about the file format
A7:33:27 <Parthon> doh :(
A7:33:33 <Parthon> I was going to write a pattern editor

A7:33:42 <Notch> and wasabi peas
A7:33:53 <iPope> nice
A7:34:08 <Notch> zid: A normal game world is 4mb
A7:34:14 <Notch> it gets compressed before it gets sent
A7:34:32 <zid> why? it's 256*256*64

A7:34:39 <C418> these 1 bit drawing bots
A7:34:49 <Parthon> oh .. you serialise the map object don't you notch?
A7:34:51 <C418> it's kind of like a printer

A7:34:54 <DeathsBrother> Yeah.
A7:34:56 <zid> C418: if he wants to he can just tell me what map he's connected to
A7:35:02 <Notch> zid: 256*256*64 = 4194304
A7:35:10 <C418> uh. you made that?
A7:35:12 <zid> I can't count :D
A7:35:23 <zid> C418: Yea, I was offering to delete it and he restarted the server instead, wtf?
A7:35:24 <Notch> I've seen a few fast moving players, and a few noclips
A7:35:26 <Notch> I know how to fix it
A7:35:32 <C418> haha
A7:35:47 <iPope> notch, have you put a limit on how fast you can talk in chat?
A7:35:50 <C418> well, he's a bit twitchy against anything that is grief in any way
A7:35:56 <Notch> not yet. good idea. =)
A7:35:58 <C418> but how do you do it? isn't that some kind of noclip?
A7:36:09 <wingboy> i had a speedhacke on my server who swore he didnt know he was speedhacking :D, he just said he though everyone went this speed
A7:36:10 <zid> it isn't a normal client
A7:36:13 <zid> it's implemented from scratch
A7:36:26 <Notch> awesome =D
10A7:36:31 * Rock_D (Mibbit@5ED41DFD.cable.ziggo.nl) has joined #minecraft
A7:36:35 <zid> 0x05 / short coord / short coord / short cord / short tile_type
A7:36:39 <zid> 0x8 is movement / look
A7:36:41 <zid> etc
A7:36:47 <Notch> =D
A7:36:47 <C418> that was no speedhack wingboy
A7:36:48 <C418> that was lag
A7:36:55 <Notch> there's a speed bug as well
A7:37:04 <Notch> where clients will start running too fast under some circumstances
A7:37:04 <zid> Notch: why is the z coord for players out?
A7:37:06 <wingboy> when he was jumping on blocks he went to fast and kept falling off
A7:37:07 <Parthon> Drakkar: are you about? Just wanted to let you know that I have colonist hauling complete :P
A7:37:20 <Notch> what?
A7:37:25 <Notch> the z coord isn't out
A7:37:29 <zid> Notch: It so is
A7:37:32 <Notch> what?
A7:37:40 <zid> 0x20 is about the normal block layer players start at
A7:37:49 <Notch> Ooooh, you mean like that
A7:37:50 <zid> which *should* mean 0x10+(0x20*0x20) as the player coord for z
A7:37:53 <Notch> i thought you meant from the protocol
A7:37:55 <zid> but it isn't
A7:37:57 <zid> it's about 0x33 out
A7:38:22 <Parthon> zid: you are confusing
A7:38:26 <Notch> yes, you are
A7:38:48 <Notch> first of all, that's y. :D
A7:38:51 <Parthon> I'm pretty sure coords are not shorts, they are probably floats, doubles or full ints
A7:38:52 <zid> whatever :)
A7:38:57 <zid> I don't have access to that info
A7:38:59 <zid> it's z in my world
A7:39:00 <smn> notch, 'nother question; in which interval is the log file written?
A7:39:04 <Notch> second of all, that's because the camera's 1.6 tiles above the ground
A7:39:09 <zid> Notch: ahhhh
A7:39:13 <zid> that explains it, cool
A7:39:13 <Notch> if I place players at ground level, the lighting messes up
A7:39:23 <zid> Why iisn't the camera just relative to the player?
A7:39:31 <Notch> coords are floats internally, shorts over the network
A7:39:40 <Notch> zid: It should be. But there was the lighting bug as well
A7:39:40 <zid> nod
A7:39:43 <Parthon> is player position measured from the floor, or from the camera position?
A7:39:54 <Notch> like if you jumped up stairs and interpolated, the feet would be inside a block sometimes
A7:40:04 <wingboy> notch i got a question about finite water, when there is just one block of water on a flat ground what happens to the water? does it stay there or move about randomly
A7:40:04 <Notch> and since that location isn't lit, the player would get dark

A7:41:01 <zid> pick one from the list then? :P

A7:42:47 <citricsquid> Just putting one online :) 2 moments
A7:42:50 <zid> kk cool
A7:42:58 <Deiz> zid: You need to automate mp-pass scraping
A7:43:09 <zid> Deiz: meh, cbf, it usually stays on the same server for ages
A7:43:25 <Notch> it's the same until you change ip or port
A7:43:34 <zid> or log in / out
A7:43:37 <Notch> no, wait, until the server restarts!
A7:43:40 <zid> nod
A7:43:44 <Notch> sorry, I thought about the server uids
A7:43:50 <zid> I kept ctrl-c'ing my server 
A7:43:57 <zid> ..accidently
13A7:44:05 * Deiz wants to know how the UIDs are generated
A7:44:12 <Notch> Deiz: Sure
A7:44:12 <zid> some hash
A7:44:23 <Deiz> zid: I tried a few IP:port combos to no avail
A7:44:24 <DeathsBrother> You could use my server, notch.
A7:44:27 <Notch> the server generates a random string at startup, sends that to the minecraft server over heartbeats
A7:44:33 <zid> at least it's not challenge response and I had to figure out the client code
A7:44:39 <Notch> both minecraft.net and the game server generates  hash out of playername+that hash
A7:44:59 <Notch> I mean that salt
A7:45:02 <Notch> not hash

A7:45:09 <zid> hashes work great as salts
A7:45:16 <citricsquid> aww bugger
A7:45:18 <Notch> so to know the mppass for a name, you need to know the secret string and the player name
A7:45:36 <zid> citricsquid: no good?
A7:45:37 <citricsquid> Running from command line using nohup doesn't return the server hash and can't use http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=66.197.153.149&port=25588 anymore :(
A7:45:37 <Notch> the player never knows the secret string, but gets told the mppass if logged in
A7:45:43 <Deiz> Won't the standalone client need to phone home to get the mp-pass then?
A7:45:53 <zid> citricsquid: none of them do
A7:45:59 <Notch> citricsquid: You can if you set verify-names to falkse
A7:46:06 <Notch> but you need to change "server" to "ip"
A7:46:17 <citricsquid> ahhh okay, I'll do that
A7:46:21 <Notch> Deiz: Yes, that's true.. hmm
A7:46:35 <DeathsBrother> What are you currently working on, notch?
A7:46:35 <Notch> if you're playing online, that's not a problem
A7:46:47 <Notch> and lan servers could disable verify-names
A7:46:53 <Deiz> Notch: I dislike phoning home, but it'd also let you keep more stats
A7:47:05 <zid> ..and stop name spoofing
A7:47:06 <Deiz> The purpose of the UID is to prevent people from logging in with names that aren't theirs, I assume?
A7:47:11 <Deiz> Beat me to it.
A7:47:12 <Notch> it'll always phone home for version updates and so
A7:47:18 <Notch> "There's a new version omgz"
A7:47:25 <Notch> that could be just a pid file though
A7:47:35 <Notch> phoning home on each server connect is a bit.. scary, agreed.
A7:47:47 <Notch> it's a sexy technical solution for secure names, though. :D
A7:47:58 <Deiz> Well
A7:48:11 <Deiz> It'll be contacting the master server anyhow, if you have an in-game server list
A7:48:14 <DeathsBrother> Notch.
A7:48:18 <zid> you can do it without phoning home, but it's gross
A7:48:33 <zid> client branding
A7:48:41 <Notch> client branding is hackable
A7:48:46 <zid> no
A7:48:48 <DeathsBrother> Notttccchhhhhh.
A7:48:53 <Notch> hm? how do you mean, then?
A7:49:08 <Notch> DeathsBrother: Sorry, nothing. I'm watching youtube and eating wasabi peas. =)

A8:00:48 <Notch> =)
A8:00:52 <Gauphastus> Got a guy dressed up like Gordon Freeman on my server.
A8:00:59 <Gauphastus> It's a good skin.

A8:01:30 <smn> i dig the super mario one

A8:01:33 <zid> cleaned your walls

A8:01:51 <zid> skybot is running

A8:02:09 <Notch> Rock_D: It averages at about 4 per hour
A8:02:19 <Rock_D> :O
A8:02:23 <mezo> thats a living
A8:02:40 <Notch> the average is 4.6 per hour since release
A8:02:52 <Notch> it's a VERY good living if it keeps going like this
A8:02:53 <mezo> time to retire and live off minecraft
A8:02:54 <Deiz> Notch: The bots lag when going over certain tiles, even if the area directly below is empty
A8:02:55 <Notch> but it won't. =)
A8:03:00 <citricsquid> I need to buy it, but I hate parting with money :D Got to buy 2 copies, 1 for me and my brother.
A8:03:01 <Polan> :d
A8:03:09 <Deiz> Does the server calculate the entire Z column below a player or something?
A8:03:19 <Deiz> And go slower on lava/water?
A8:03:23 <Notch> no, the server doesn't check player locations at all yet
A8:03:29 <zid> ya think? :P
A8:03:31 <Rock_D> I'd like to make a thousand dollars a day :/
A8:03:32 <Polan> ok I will repeat question: is there any way to set up custom skin on mobs? I want to see my skin ingame not only in upload window :d
A8:03:32 <Deiz> Well, I'm wondering why there are big slowdowns
A8:03:47 <Deiz> Because the bot's movement being unimpeded, and clientside, I don't see a reason for the slowdown
A8:03:49 <zid> Deiz: your version is old and buggy remember
A8:03:52 <Notch> Rock_D: It's crazy, I've made 15k euro in 1.5 days :-O
A8:03:53 <Deiz> Yes.
A8:03:57 <zid> nor can you actually read C
A8:04:01 <Notch> well, paypal has
A8:04:06 <Evil-Ville> Notch did you miss what I said or are you ignoring me
A8:04:09 <Notch> but I've withdrawn most of it, let's ssee if I ever get it
A8:04:10 <Deiz> zid: Does the bee version lag over certain terrain?
A8:04:10 <mezo> that's insane
A8:04:14 <Notch> I probably missed it, Evil-Ville
A8:04:14 <Rock_D> err, you mean 1.5k
A8:04:15 <citricsquid> You'll probably get 20EURO of that after Paypal fees
A8:04:17 <Notch> I'm not ignoring. =)
A8:04:20 <Notch> err, yes. 1.5k
A8:04:21 <mezo> yea
A8:04:24 <Polan> :o
A8:04:24 <Notch> I keep thinking swedish money, sorry
A8:04:29 <Rock_D> 15k lol
A8:04:31 <Evil-Ville> <Evil-Ville> Notch: For survival mode, what if not eating for days made you weaker so you would have a reason to get food even though you might have full health

A8:04:43 <Notch> oh that, I saw, but didn't know what to reply. Maybe. =D
A8:04:45 <zid> Deiz: want me to rewrite skybot some?
A8:04:51 <Deiz> Might as well
A8:04:58 <Evil-Ville> Oh.
A8:04:59 <Deiz> You could also just take the sky algo
A8:05:06 <Deiz> And plop it into the bee movement/draw, no?
A8:05:14 <zid> it's the same algo
A8:05:19 <zid> just one does an array lookup on the tile colour
A8:05:23 <zid> instead of usng 0xC
A8:05:24 <zid> for stone
A8:05:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Dun-dun-dun...
A8:05:53 <Haruhi2> what's skybot?
A8:06:01 <Notch> I'm going to wait with fixing those hacks

A8:06:15 <vdgmprgrmr> And guess what?
A8:06:16 <Notch> people can write very efficient griefbots
A8:06:19 <zid> citricsquid: Mind if I do some testing on this server?
A8:06:19 <Polan> ! finaly server that is not destroyed by griefers..
A8:06:22 <vdgmprgrmr> It's got a secret cult.

A8:06:40 <Haruhi2> I want to see skybot
A8:06:58 <Deiz> Notch: As I see it, work to protect from the simplest stuff which can be done by any bonehead with a memory editor
A8:07:07 <vdgmprgrmr> If you find the three members, and their place of worship, you're cool.
A8:07:10 <Deiz> Given that there's no bot source circulating, I think this'll be the only one for a while
A8:07:18 <Notch> i won't be able to stop all bots. But the obvious low hanging fruit, absolutely

A8:07:48 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A8:07:50 <Gauphastus> Do you think you could implement an idle kick?
A8:07:52 <Deiz> The more limits you add, the smarter the bot has to get
A8:07:53 <Notch> zid's made a painter bot. =)
A8:08:02 <vdgmprgrmr> ???
A8:08:06 <Polan> :d bee wallpaper?
A8:08:06 <Notch> Gauphastus: Sure, but not yet
A8:08:12 <Gauphastus> Cool.
A8:08:17 <Haruhi2> what does skybot do
A8:08:21 <Gauphastus> I just have all these poor disconnected guys but they hang in the air.
A8:08:22 <Gauphastus> And stuff.
A8:08:27 <mezo> most of your post-release effort should go into bot killing imo
A8:08:28 <Gauphastus> We usually build boxes around them.
A8:08:29 <Gauphastus> :)
A8:08:32 <mezo> and especially clientside cheats
A8:08:40 <Notch> hmm, the server is supposed to ping players
A8:08:44 <Deiz> mezo: You can't kill bots.
A8:08:44 <Notch> must be broken
A8:08:45 <zid> Notch: it does
A8:08:51 <zid> Notch: it sends 0x1 every half second
A8:08:51 <Notch> ok, good. =D
A8:08:55 <mezo> there's a way to make them not work
A8:08:58 <zid> disconnected clients would cause read() errors on the server side
A8:08:59 <Notch> every half second? whoa, haha
A8:09:03 <CheeToS> Notch: are you gonna enable software rendering? I want to play :>
A8:09:07 <zid> Notch: if the server is idle yes
A8:09:15 <zid> Notch: if stuff s happening they don't seem to happen at all
A8:09:23 <Notch> neat
A8:09:28 <zid> but this is just from watching the odd packet dump
A8:09:30 <zid> no real study
A8:09:33 <Notch> hehe
A8:09:41 <Notch> i remember vaguely trying to be clever
A8:09:43 <Notch> but it was a long time ago now
A8:12:02 <Deiz> Notch: You should add a 'defaultspawn' flag
A8:12:13 <Deiz> Which is set to 0 when a player sets their spawn location
A8:12:24 <Deiz> But players who haven't set it have their spawn location changed when the admin /setspawns

13A8:16:06 * Deiz shakes fist at keyboard focus
A8:16:15 <vdgmprgrmr> Notch!
A8:16:33 <vdgmprgrmr> I really don't like the idea of having just a time delay for destroying blocks.
13A8:16:36 * CheeToS stares at http://www.minecraft.net/skin/ , entranced
A8:16:53 <Notch> what do you suggest?
A8:17:08 <vdgmprgrmr> I think there should be NO delay, but the pickaxe should have some sort of condition meter, and the condition is decreased at differing rates depending on the block you destroy.
A8:17:22 <Notch> i disagree
A8:17:32 <Deiz> Notch: Subdivide the map per player, have them buy and sell sections of it to eachother of Minecraft Points. Microtransactions $$$
A8:17:32 <vdgmprgrmr> Having to just idle for a second every time you destroy a block would just be frustrating.
A8:17:40 <Notch> you need to be able to build walls that keep people out
A8:17:55 <notcitricsquid> It'd be nice if server settings could be set up to either allow or disallow destroying others blocks, might add extra overhead - storing the owner of each block - but it'd be good for preventing some griefing, but then it would also change the game dynamic and make it suck :(
A8:18:11 <Deiz> That can't work
10A8:18:19 * ez (ez@c80-216-185-249.bredband.comhem.se) has joined #minecraft
A8:18:20 <Deiz> Unless you set sections where one player can build and another can't
A8:18:28 <Deiz> Otherwise a griefer could fill in your building
A8:18:41 <mezo> all those server settings would be excellent
A8:18:49 <vdgmprgrmr> Well, ideally it would be each block having HP, but that might take up more memory.
A8:18:52 <mezo> server settings for numbers like that are awesome
10A8:18:53 * ChanServ sets mode: +o ez
A8:18:54 <vdgmprgrmr> more=too much
A8:19:00 <zid> I've lost my bot..
A8:19:08 <flak> you can't prevent griefing on public servers
A8:19:13 <flak> except mass bans
A8:19:17 <Haggle> How- about block HP? and you have to hit stone blocks a few times... eh... No...
A8:19:17 <Deiz> zid: Still crashing?
A8:19:32 <Haggle> like two...
A8:19:34 <zid> there he goes :P
A8:19:36 <notcitricsquid> all I want to see is trap blocks that look like normal blocks but you fall through, game will be perfect then ;)
A8:19:38 <Zolyx> flak: not entirely true, you can keep your level backed up and roll it back when needed
A8:19:52 <mezo> have join_minedelay and join_craftdelay as server settings, then you could keep people from touching anything for like 30 seconds or whatever
A8:19:58 <vdgmprgrmr> I still really think a simple delay on blocks would not be good.
A8:19:58 <Haggle> Or one...
A8:19:59 <Evil-Ville> I don't have any problem with delay between destroying blocks
A8:20:22 <flak> but if you keep rolling back, you cannot build anything
A8:20:30 <flak> it would be read-only server
A8:20:50 <vdgmprgrmr> Wait, how are you going to handle the delay, Notch?
A8:20:51 <zid> I think the biggest reduction in griefing would come from changing the default action to build
A8:20:52 <mezo> i have a map that's from before trees
A8:20:57 <mezo> and it's still moddable
A8:20:57 <Zolyx> that depends how quick your ops are with the ban stick
A8:20:58 <Notch> i don't know yet
A8:21:03 <Notch> not in an annoying way
A8:21:06 <Haruhi2> i found the cult headquarters but not the 3 members
A8:21:17 <mezo> i have suggestions for that notch, along with everything else of course
A8:21:19 <Evil-Ville> Maybe you should sometimes get more than one resource unit from a single block though so it would be a bit more interesting
A8:21:25 <mezo> i just havent spoken them in this busy channel
A8:21:27 <Deiz> Per-player build zones would remove all griefing.
A8:21:33 <vdgmprgrmr> Will it be you having to sit and stare at the block for the delay, or you hit the block, destroy it immediately, and then you have to let your pickaxe "warm up" until you can do it again.
A8:21:36 <Deiz> But you'd need a way to prevent they themselves from being abused
A8:21:45 <smn> 10 minutes until my crontab has to do it's first job
A8:21:45 <notcitricsquid> Problem with any grief blocking is it also affects legit users and makes the game less interactive
A8:21:49 <Gauphastus> Oh, Notch. I had a problem with banip.
A8:21:49 <smn> wish me luck, people
A8:21:57 <Haggle> So is a pick axe a weapon? can I hit people in the eye with my pick axe?
A8:21:59 <flak> maybe add one more administrative option - put player in read-only mode?
A8:22:09 <Gauphastus> If they grief real quick and then quit, I can't add their ip to the banlist.
A8:22:10 <flak> so he can walk around, but cannot build/destroy
A8:22:12 <Evil-Ville> I think so Haggle
A8:22:20 <Gauphastus> I can do it manually, but it doesn't stick unless I restart the server.
A8:22:32 <Haruhi2> Notch what about admins just being able to lock tiles?
A8:22:33 <Haggle> 'k.
A8:22:36 <Gauphastus> Maybe make it so I can add IPs and names in-game freely even if they're not online.
A8:22:39 <mezo> notcitricsquid: that's not really tru in this case, build/mine delays would be good for both gameplay and anti-griefing
A8:22:45 <mezo> true*
A8:22:53 <vdgmprgrmr> I like the idea of a spectator mode (read-only not exactly a good term, I think).
A8:23:02 <notcitricsquid> mezo: how so? Wouldn't it take away from the 'freeness' of the game?
A8:23:06 <vdgmprgrmr> And being able to force players in to spectator as an admin.
A8:23:23 <mezo> i dont think any delay is being considered for creative mode
A8:23:28 <mezo> i could be wrong there
A8:23:46 <mezo> the multiplayer landscape will probably change quite a bit once the 'real' game is out
A8:23:51 <vdgmprgrmr> No, pretty sure delay is just for survival and such.
A8:24:30 <notcitricsquid> ahh, doesn't sound as bad in survival.
A8:24:46 <smn> how come that my serverlog hasn't been written for over an hour?
A8:24:49 <vdgmprgrmr> But still, really depends on how the delay works.
A8:24:51 <smn> what's the logging interval? :O
A8:24:56 <notcitricsquid> I think if we have votekick most griefing problems will go, except for mass vote kicking against good people.
A8:25:04 <Evil-Ville> What difference does it make vdgmprgrmr
A8:25:11 <Notch> good idea, Gauphastus
A8:25:25 <Gauphastus> It would really help me out. :)
A8:25:46 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, if you hit the block, and you're forced to just sit there and stare at it for a few seconds, it would be bad.
A8:26:08 <notcitricsquid> Problem I find with a /ban <name> system is tricky names, is it possible to have a GUI? Click to ban for admins?
A8:26:16 <vdgmprgrmr> But if you hit the block and destroy it, and the only thing to deal with is a varying warm-up time on your pickaxe, it would be more tolerable.
A8:26:23 <Deiz> notcitricsquid: I suggested tab-completion
A8:26:27 <Zolyx> ./agree with notcitric
A8:26:30 <notcitricsquid> Clicking on a name could append it to the text box at the end, so I could type /ban then click their name and it adds to the field?
A8:26:43 <Gauphastus> Also, if other admins could see player IPs, that'd be great.
A8:26:44 <Evil-Ville> What's the difference between pickaxe warm-up time and sitting there looking at the block
A8:26:58 <Gauphastus> The only place you can see IPs at the moment is in the server console.
A8:27:02 <Evil-Ville> They both seem to do the exact same thing the exact same way
A8:27:05 <Gauphastus> Which none of them have any access to obviously.
A8:27:07 <Gauphastus> :P
A8:27:15 <vdgmprgrmr> No they don't, Evil-Ville.
A8:27:22 <Evil-Ville> So what's the difference
A8:27:22 <vdgmprgrmr> In one, you're stuck in place.
A8:27:27 <DeathsBrother> I suggested that earlier notcitric.
A8:27:27 <DeathsBrother> :P
A8:27:34 <notcitricsquid> :'( :P
A8:27:34 <vdgmprgrmr> In the other, you've just got a warm-up, and you can still move about.
A8:27:45 <Evil-Ville> What the fuck are you talking about
A8:27:50 <DeathsBrother> I also suggested the 'Have certain people allowed to build in a certain area'
A8:27:50 <vdgmprgrmr> What?
A8:28:04 <Evil-Ville> Why would you not be able to move with normal delay?
A8:28:04 <vdgmprgrmr> Alright, let me outline this for the third time here.
A8:28:04 <DeathsBrother> But I said multiple people, not just one, that are designated by admins.
A8:28:08 <DeathsBrother> The area is also designated by admins.
A8:28:24 <vdgmprgrmr> DELAY 1: You hit the block... You are stuck in place until the block is destroyed...
A8:28:30 <Polan> aw.. why sand box must fall ;(
A8:28:40 <Polan> making collosus now can't finish due to falling sand :P
A8:28:41 <Evil-Ville> But the block is destroyed instantly and then you wait afterwards to destroy a new block
A8:28:45 <Evil-Ville> That's what delays are
A8:29:04 <vdgmprgrmr> DELAY 2: You hit the block... the block is destroyed... you may move freely until the warm-up ends.
A8:29:18 <vdgmprgrmr> The first is more realistic, but not as fun.
A8:29:18 <notcitricsquid> "Thank you for purchasing Minecraft! Your status should update soon." :D
A8:29:25 <vdgmprgrmr> The second is more fun, but not as realistic.
A8:29:44 <Evil-Ville> I don't understand where you got the idea it would be like the first one
A8:29:47 <mezo> both of those dont sound too good
A8:29:55 <DeathsBrother> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8ddcd3905567acb4cda924f2ccc8f926 I'm lonely, someone come play. :D
A8:30:07 <vdgmprgrmr> Evil-Ville, because the first is most realistic.
A8:30:19 <DeathsBrother> Also, grats citric.
A8:30:28 <Evil-Ville> Since when has this game been about realism
A8:30:28 <vdgmprgrmr> You know, you hit the block, and you have to sit there working at it a bit until it's destroyed.
A8:30:43 <vdgmprgrmr> When he wanted to add a challenging survival game to it.
A8:31:14 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm sorry, just because it's not about realism doesn't mean there can be NO realistic elements at all.
A8:31:35 <vdgmprgrmr> Which means that the first one was a possibility.
A8:32:43 <Evil-Ville> Uh I just read what notch wrote again maybe you're right
A8:33:55 <Notch> if the system i make sucks, PLEASE tell me
A8:33:59 <Notch> I don't want it to be annoying

A8:34:12 <Notch> but trust in me to implement it first. =D
A8:34:17 <vdgmprgrmr> Oh trust me, we'll (or at least I will) tell you.
A8:34:20 <Notch> smn: I don't think so..
A8:34:22 <smn> dammit
A8:34:25 <Notch> good =D
A8:34:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Probably somewhat loudly.
A8:34:48 <smn> i need longer motds.. or like i was saying, a motd that shows up in the chatlog on join
A8:34:52 <smn> just like an admin/say
A8:35:00 <smn> :D
A8:35:10 <smn> i could add a WoW-reference here...
A8:35:23 <vdgmprgrmr> I think having an image you can upload to be a sort of splash screen for your server when it loads would be good.
A8:35:34 <vdgmprgrmr> So you could include all types of things if you want.
A8:35:37 <notcitricsquid> awww, I hoped a transparent .png would work  as a skin :D
A8:35:44 <smn> :D
A8:35:55 <vdgmprgrmr> Rules, cool theme image or something, even both!

A8:37:15 <smn> but well

A8:37:30 <Evil-Ville> Deiz isn't that still in source engine games
A8:37:42 <Deiz> Evil-Ville: Yes, but it's no longer as broken.
A8:37:50 <Deiz> In GoldSrc the scroll bars wouldn't work sometimes
A8:37:58 <notcitricsquid> I'm in the process of making an automatic backup and return tool, backs up every 5 mins and at the click of a button it restores to the previous version with 6 previous versions kept :)
A8:38:00 <smn> 30 minutes is fair enough so i can keep backups that go 1 week back easily without messing up my server's hdd space
A8:38:11 <Evil-Ville> The source ones are still mostly horrible though
A8:38:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Not that I've seen...
A8:38:30 <smn> heh, my version is a php script launched every 30 minutes by crontab
A8:38:54 <Notch> just be careful about copying the map while the server is saving..

A8:39:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Small!
A8:39:28 <smn> both!

A8:41:14 <Delamore> You want to try out both small and large so we have an idea what they look like
A8:41:39 <Snowman> gauph...
A8:41:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Or you could make it so that they're small until you scroll, then the little menu kind of pops to the foreground and they get bigger.
A8:41:45 <Gauphastus> Yo.

A8:44:07 <smn> q_q
A8:44:07 <prakCurie> Text means you don't have to struggle with getting the art right for icons when adding something new.
A8:44:07 <Notch> it's updating as often as it can, as far as I know

A8:44:21 <Deiz> Notch: Need a #minecraft-devel channel to escape the chatter
A8:44:30 <smn> well, half an hour ago, it didn't update for an hour or so, which made me curious

A8:58:29 <vdgmprgrmr> In competitive multiplayer modes, like team deathmatch or CTF, it's important to have team colors, and having custom skins might kind of undermine that. So I suggest that for multiplayer, you have one color (maybe all-white, or all-black) that, when on a texture, is identified as team-color, and pixels with that color are change to the team color. And it is required that you have x% of team color pixels on your
A8:58:29 <vdgmprgrmr>  custom skin to be able to play competitive multiplayer with a custom skin, otherwise you are given a default skin.

A8:59:17 <Nyymo> I neeeed help.
A8:59:26 <Gauphastus> What's the prob?
A8:59:33 <vdgmprgrmr> No, you place the team-color pixels yourself, so you can choose where they are, so you could keep your face anyway.
A8:59:46 <Nyymo> Well it's the mouse, the buttons just don't do anything.

A9:24:03 <Delamore> Evil is right
A9:24:12 <citricsquid> a little name over the head that indicates team would be fine?
A9:24:19 <vdgmprgrmr> But custom team-color locations would be wy cool!
A9:24:21 <vdgmprgrmr> *way
A9:24:34 <citricsquid> what about a little map showing their location? :D
A9:24:40 <vdgmprgrmr> And you can't see the names above heads when someone's in a low hallway.
A9:24:45 <ez> map and compass
A9:24:54 <Haruhi2> give them an outline that matches the team color
A9:25:18 <Evil-Ville> You shouldn't be able to see the names of guys on enemy team either way
A9:25:21 <ez> just a compass in the game would be nice I think
A9:25:25 <vdgmprgrmr> Outlines would look weird, I think.
A9:25:32 <Delamore> Why should you not  see their names?
A9:25:34 <vdgmprgrmr> And yeah, a compass would be good.
A9:25:39 <Delamore> Colored names is the simplest fix to the issue
A9:25:47 <Delamore> Rather than forcing people to make new skins
A9:25:51 <Evil-Ville> Because it gives away their location so well
A9:26:00 <Delamore> Guess what also gives away their location?
A9:26:06 <Delamore> Colored skins
A9:26:10 <ez> delamore, they can just get skins auto
A9:26:36 <ez> u cant always see player names
A9:26:39 <Rock_D> Notch: If I'm not mistaken, the skins are mirrored
A9:26:44 <vdgmprgrmr> How do colored skins give away location?

A9:27:16 <Delamore> Make them always visible

A9:27:35 <Evil-Ville> Enough to tell which team the guy is on

A9:28:17 <Notch> can anyone verify?
A9:28:19 <prakCurie> I hope most of these options are just left up to the server.  So long as you are letting people run their own servers you might as well let them decide the best way to play whatever it they are trying to do.
A9:28:24 <Evil-Ville> But still I think you shouldn't be able to see the names of enemies because you don't really need to do so to differentiate between friend and foe
A9:28:31 <ez> yes, Zolyx Z was mirrored 
A9:28:36 <Delamore> But it doesn't cause any harm Evil
A9:28:38 <Notch> ok, thank you
A9:28:41 <Delamore> By seeing the name you do not change the game one bit
A9:29:15 <Evil-Ville> They feel more like enemies and less like buddies if you don't know who they are alright
A9:29:28 <Delamore> Not really
A9:29:36 <vdgmprgrmr> I still think custom team-colors would be cool...
A9:29:43 <ez> lol
A9:29:54 <ez> :)
A9:30:39 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, Evil-Ville, you have some sort of problem slaughtering buddies? Freak.
A9:30:51 <citricsquid> You know the gold we get? It'd be nice if we could place it places so people have a reason to explore our creations.
A9:31:14 <vdgmprgrmr> A friend of mine actually told me to request that you add an ore-counter.
A9:31:21 <vdgmprgrmr> Not any impact on gameplay or anything.
A9:31:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Just three little counters.
A9:31:43 <vdgmprgrmr> And I agreed.
A9:31:54 <Delamore> For that you need to add it into the hud design
A9:32:00 <Delamore> Waste of time for something that will change later
A9:32:20 <vdgmprgrmr> It wouldn't even need to have images.
A9:32:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Just text.
A9:32:29 <vdgmprgrmr> Right below the FPS and such.
A9:32:30 <Delamore> Vdgm
A9:32:36 <Delamore> It will change the game for 5 people
A9:32:44 <Delamore> It will be removed as soon as an actual hud gets added
A9:32:48 <Delamore> It is a terrible waste of time
A9:32:57 <vdgmprgrmr> Terrible waste of how much time?
A9:33:12 <Empty> Time is the most precious commodity for a programmer.
A9:33:16 <Delamore> It is time that could be better spent
A9:33:22 <Empty> Air is second.
A9:33:32 <citricsquid> Caffiene is first.
A9:33:34 <Delamore> Why multiplayer and survival before the rest of the game?
A9:33:46 <Delamore> They effect the most players for the least time investment
A9:34:10 <Polan> did you know that water cool down lava to rock ?O_O
A9:34:19 <vdgmprgrmr> Yes, we all knew that.
A9:34:26 <Evil-Ville> I still don't see the point of telling you the names of enemies sorry
A9:34:32 <Delamore> Evil
A9:34:38 <Delamore> Because it is the simplest system to show team color
A9:34:39 <Polan> but ingame.. :D
A9:34:45 <prakCurie> "There's no way to dam off the ocean, because as far as I know, any wall you can put up can be torn down. I was hoping to find a way to make an undiggable block, but I don't think it's possible just by modifying save files. I hoped element 7 or 8 would be titanium or something, but they were just regular stone and water."
A9:34:58 <Empty> Hmm. Not showing enemy names might be a plus.
A9:35:07 <Empty> Would stop alot of grieving whining.
A9:35:17 <Delamore> Uh, how?
A9:35:27 <vdgmprgrmr> Stop a lot of whining about griefing?
A9:35:29 <Empty> If you don't know your enemy you can't whine about him.
A9:35:33 <Empty> I mean in vs mode.
A9:35:35 <Delamore> Empty
A9:35:39 <vdgmprgrmr> WHERE IS THE BENEFIT?
A9:35:39 <Delamore> If you are whining about griefing
A9:35:47 <Delamore> Either they are not griefing you, in which case you should get banned
A9:35:54 <Delamore> Or they are griefing you in which case they should get banned

A9:40:14 <prakCurie> Yes.  Unfortunately the autogenerated maps put quite a bit of stuff below sea level.  So if you are interested in seeing what you can do without making your entire structure from scratch you are likely stuck with stuff you might want to use that is also below sea level.
A9:40:54 <vdgmprgrmr> The best way to fix that?
A9:41:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Play on a private server.
A9:41:06 <prakCurie> The addition of a block type that cannot be added/removed by the client would solve this with what might be minimal work.
A9:41:17 <vdgmprgrmr> With only trusted people.
A9:41:26 <vdgmprgrmr> And ban people you don't know on sight.
A9:41:26 <zid> or just do backups
A9:41:28 <Empty> An option to exlude oceans might work as well on map generation.
A9:41:37 <zid> Empty: i'd like that

A9:42:03 <mezo> yes
A9:42:45 <prakCurie> Yes.  I'm not saying that there are not already ways to work around the problem right now.  I was suggesting that might be something to consider adding (assuming it didn't require too much work.)
A9:42:46 <ez> yeh deserts!
A9:42:48 <Deiz> Notch: Dirt connected to water should grow grass
A9:42:54 <Deiz> That way you don't end up with dead dirt islands
A9:43:05 <Deiz> Or, in the case of the skybot temporarily shading the whole map, dead maps
A9:43:07 <Notch> good idea =D
A9:43:16 <Daidoji> can we get a non-grass growing dirt
A9:43:24 <Daidoji> maybe slightly darker I guess
A9:43:29 <vdgmprgrmr> I agree with Daidoji.
A9:43:37 <ez> I want different plants :P
A9:43:43 <Empty> Use the non flowing gravel.
A9:43:44 <vdgmprgrmr> Essential for having working dirt-roads.

A9:44:14 <Notch> I believe I can fly fly through the sky, very high.
A9:44:16 <Empty> I want to be able to poop after eating alot.
A9:44:22 <prakCurie> Why not just have blocks next to a tree block grow grass?
A9:44:42 <Daidoji> or just have a grass tile 
A9:44:45 <Empty> prakCurie what if someone makes a tree underground?
A9:44:48 <Daidoji> that's already grass
A9:44:48 <Deiz> Notch: Given that player and tile coords are different, isn't not possible to have a tile (like sand/gravel) fall to the ground instead of just instantly teleporting, is it?
A9:45:07 <Notch> i could fake it client side, possibly
A9:45:13 <Notch> but it's fairly advanced to do so
A9:45:24 <Empty> Don't make the clients to smart.

A9:46:46 <Daidoji> could have fooled me

A9:46:58 <prakCurie> Perhaps it is now?

A9:47:12 <Notch> there's a 50% chance of no fall damage on each fall in wurm
A9:47:18 <Empty> Hmm.
A9:47:19 <Notch> or perhaps the odds are different now
A9:47:25 <Daidoji> maybe but bouncing around in a mine would confuse the server maybe
A9:47:27 <Empty> That I did not know.

A10:00:33 <doohan> 404 Daidoji 
A10:00:46 <Delamore> Ok the discussion about Rolf
A10:00:49 <Daidoji> it's only a 404 if you live in some backwater country like norway or france!
A10:00:50 <iPope> I don't think were guna get alpha
A10:00:53 <Delamore> Rolf never goes back to old features ever
A10:00:54 <doohan> UK
A10:00:54 <Haruhi2> alpha channels on skins would be a really bad idea
A10:00:58 <Delamore> The design process works like this
A10:00:58 <prakCurie> I found it odd that water flowing in from sea level did not fill my pit to sea level as well.  At least when channeled underground first.
A10:01:02 <Daidoji> no
A10:01:06 <Delamore> You have a concept " I want regional creatures"
A10:01:08 <iPope> for the reason tat greifers would be invisible
A10:01:09 <Daidoji> there's a way you can make it still work
A10:01:13 <Delamore> So he adds lairs
A10:01:17 <Daidoji> by having an alpha %
A10:01:26 <Delamore> Lairs are bugged, so he fixes it by making them decay to back around the bug

A10:04:53 <Daidoji> simple solution: water blocks

A10:04:59 <Daidoji> if you wanted to make a waterfall
A10:05:02 <mezo> but i know it's probably not happening
A10:05:08 <Empty> This game deserves to be bought.
A10:05:15 <Daidoji> it would look weird and you'd have to delete the waterblock

A10:05:25 <Deiz> Water pressure is exceedingly hard to do well in the context of Minecraft
A10:05:29 <prakCurie> Will we get pumps at least?

A10:05:40 <mezo> ultimately it can be done
A10:05:46 <citricsquid> awwww, I was hoping water would go like a waterfall if I layered the thing, but it doesn't :'(
A10:05:46 <mezo> the whole game doesnt have to be easy to code
A10:05:56 <iPope> or a sort of pipe system
A10:06:02 <Testvan> what about the lighting?

A10:06:29 <prakCurie> Pumps and finite water, even without water pressure, pretty much covers most of what I would imagine my water needs are.
A10:06:36 <hey5000> Hey, if  anyone has time, I need help trying to reduce lag when on the highest render
A10:06:39 <vdgmprgrmr> And I'm still wondering what kind of solution you came up with that he was so interested in.
A10:07:34 <iPope> Its so annoying I can't get water above sea level
A10:07:49 <citricsquid> one thing I dislike about the game atm is the lack of an object, it's awesome building stuff but after I want others to explore it, but the new game modes will solve this :D yayminecraft
A10:08:06 <iPope> Thats the point I think squid
A10:08:33 <vdgmprgrmr> citricsquid, you have to be clever and make it so that it has an objective.
A10:08:36 <Deiz> vdgmprgrmr: Light would bleed. Direct sunlight = Lit. A tile has the brightness of the brightest neighbouring tile - 1 if it's not directly lit.
A10:08:46 <Deiz> With an arbitrary number of levels going from fully lit -> black
A10:08:55 <Deiz> Such that a cave mouth has gradual dimming
A10:09:03 <vdgmprgrmr> That sounds pretty cool.
A10:09:07 <Deiz> And within the cave it's nearly black and you need a lamp object
A10:09:16 <ez> fire!
A10:09:19 <vdgmprgrmr> And fast, too, I'd guess.
A10:09:27 <Deiz> Reasonably

A10:11:37 <vdgmprgrmr> Very lame.
A10:11:39 <iPope> Its like a huge puddles
13A10:11:44 * smn is currently uploading awesomeness
A10:12:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Maybe if some sort of shelf-type thing were implemented.
A10:12:20 <iPope> ?
A10:12:23 <vdgmprgrmr> Where the depth under water would be gradual for a few steps away from land, then it would automatically plummet.
A10:12:36 <iPope> i like it
A10:13:00 <iPope> One problem I see is it is real hard to clear trees
A10:13:30 <Delamore> Fix: The tree top dies when not connected to wood
A10:13:39 <ez> there are deeper oceans, depends on the map
A10:14:02 <vdgmprgrmr> I haven't seen a single one in the newer versions.
A10:14:03 <mezo> <Deiz> vdgmprgrmr: Light would bleed. Direct sunlight = Lit. A tile has the brightness of the brightest neighbouring tile - 1 if it's not directly lit.
A10:14:09 <mezo> this would result in a lack of shadows
A10:14:15 <Deiz> No it wouldn't.
A10:14:23 <Deiz> Note the -1
A10:14:26 <mezo> a cave would be pretty well lit like 5 tiles in
A10:14:26 <flak> there would be blurry shadows
A10:14:31 <mezo> tyea
A10:14:35 <mezo> having a hard time picturing it
A10:14:44 <ez> grass fire and crops grow better afterwards :) different soil
A10:14:45 <smn> 10 minutes until awesomeness! :D
A10:14:48 <Deiz> There would be a fairly small number of shadow levels
A10:14:54 <citricsquid> Does setspawn work?
A10:14:56 <vdgmprgrmr> I'm having a perfect time picturing it.
A10:15:00 <Deiz> Say, 3 or 5 brightness levels
A10:15:01 <prakCurie> "2. Unzip "server_level.dat".
A10:15:10 <prakCurie> Er, oops.
A10:15:23 <iPope> I understand this lighting thing
A10:15:27 <Deiz> The middle shadow level would be roughly what the current shadow level is now.
A10:15:44 <prakCurie> "1. go to your server directory.
A10:15:46 <prakCurie> 2. Unzip "server_level.dat".
A10:15:47 <prakCurie> 3. In the unzipped file, there's a sequence of characters that represent the level data. The sequence lies between the 318th character and the (318 + 64*256*256)th character, approximately. Within that region, replace all instances of 9(water) with 0(air). Not the characters '9' and '0', mind you. I mean byte values 9 and 0. Those correspond to the Tab and Null characters.
A10:15:49 <prakCurie> 4. Re-zip the unzipped file. I think you specifically need gzip for this part or the server won't recognize it. Try "gzip --fast [filename]"
A10:15:50 <prakCurie> 5. Rename the re-zipped file to "server_level.dat"
A10:15:52 <prakCurie> 6. Start server, enjoy. "
A10:16:23 <prakCurie> Hope that is enough to get you started on your own map generator.
A10:16:47 <iPope> right
A10:17:25 <vdgmprgrmr> It very well could be for people who really want to...
A10:17:41 <smn> indeed
A10:18:00 <vdgmprgrmr> Hell, I THOUGHT about it, but decided not to.

A10:54:58 <Deiz> Notch: Regarding lighting, I think height should be taken into account
A10:55:15 <Deiz> Say you went with 3 brightness levels, full, moderate shadow, near-black
A10:55:27 <Deiz> You build a little hut on flat ground with a roof and no windows, so it's black inside
A10:55:48 <aeiowu> then how do you mine?
A10:55:56 <aeiowu> that'd suck
A10:55:57 <Deiz> aeiowu: With lights.
A10:56:01 <aeiowu> hmm
A10:57:07 <Deiz> Notch: You then dig down so there's three steps down and three steps up, so that there's there's no line of sight between the inside and outside floor
A10:57:10 <Imapanda> A torch block would be nice in that occasion.
A10:57:18 <Deiz> Light should propagate in but dimly
A10:58:07 <citricsquid> when water and lava collide they create a block
A10:58:12 <citricsquid> destroying that block pushes the lava back
A10:58:17 <citricsquid> shouldn't it be the other way around?
A10:58:33 <Deiz> So perhaps make light lose brightness as it propagates upwards/downwards
A10:58:47 <Deiz> citricsquid: As in, push the water back?
A10:59:01 <Deiz> Or bring the lava forward?
A10:59:11 <Notch> water runs faster than lava
A10:59:21 <Polan> but lava is hooott
A10:59:23 <Notch> when either one of them hits the other, the target tile becomes rock
A10:59:32 <Polan> water should boil..
A10:59:34 <Notch> and it kinda makes sense, since the rock IS the lava
A10:59:41 <citricsquid> Yeah, but if you break that rock
A10:59:44 <citricsquid> the water goes forward
A10:59:46 <citricsquid> and lava back
A10:59:47 <ReaperSWE> lava is just molten rock..
A11:00:00 <Deiz> citricsquid: Because water fills the space first
A11:00:01 <citricsquid> I'd have thought it would have been the opposite
A11:00:04 <Deiz> And hits the lava behind it
A11:00:06 <ReaperSWE> or in this game, it'd rather be magma
A11:00:08 <citricsquid> good point, oops :P
A11:00:11 <Notch> really? It makes sense to me
A11:00:28 <Notch> i might just be used to it, though
A11:00:35 <Notch> it's a bit hard trying to keep an open mind
A11:00:40 <Imapanda> "Liquid hot mag-ma."
A11:00:42 <Notch> I get used to how things work
A11:00:49 <C418> and now we all have to watch terminator 2 for it is the best terminator. we all know all terminators except 2 suck
A11:00:55 <Sonict> What the game really needs is a compass and a coordinate system so a player can say where he is and it would be easier to find them. Also, there needs to be a server option to make either a tiny, normal or large map. There seems to be only a large map option right now
A11:00:59 <citricsquid> It makes sense when the speed is mentioned, I was assuming both moved at the same speed.
A11:01:19 <Evil-Ville> I think solidified lava should look different than normal rock
A11:01:19 <citricsquid> sonct: I think there's a teleport to player feature being implemented
A11:01:21 <ReaperSWE> Now Notch, will you be turning water into dynamicly flowing liquid in any nearby future, or keep it in it's current magical-self-multiplying state?
A11:01:35 <Notch> I will make it work better
A11:01:37 <Notch> I don't know how soon
A11:01:41 <ReaperSWE> good.
A11:01:55 <ReaperSWE> sortof annoying to be digging a large cave, only to have one cubit of water fill it all up
A11:02:05 <Notch> it's in the gray area between "not now" and "i want to do it soon"
A11:02:13 <Notch> hehe
A11:02:18 <ReaperSWE> :-)
A11:02:29 <citricsquid> I tried to make a huge waterfall thinking that water would only be 1 block tall if there was nothing on the otherside, but id didn't :'(
A11:02:43 <Haruhi2> citricsquid: obsidian
A11:02:55 <Haruhi2> er

A11:04:46 <ReaperSWE> they're on all servers.
A11:05:04 <Evil-Ville> Yeah some 4chan /b/ idiots decided it would be fun
A11:05:29 <Deiz> Notch: Do you think altering light propagation based on height would make the calculations much more expensive?
A11:05:52 <Notch> i want it to be uniform from a design perspective
A11:05:55 <Notch> but, no
A11:06:03 <Notch> it'd probably be free, for certain values of free
A11:06:16 <Notch> the actual propagation itself is what'll cost
A11:06:17 <Haggle> Notch, do you think people that catch fire will be able to produce light?
A11:06:28 <Deiz> I like that

A11:06:48 <ReaperSWE> ..or yourself, for a light that follows you.
A11:06:53 <Deiz> Notch: Why not?
A11:07:00 <Notch> They'd be tile based!
A11:07:03 <Notch> it might work, though
A11:07:16 <Notch> but when carrying a torch, you'd see large snaps when you move into a new tile

A11:08:43 <Zuriki> Ah I see.
A11:08:58 <citricsquid> It'd be cool if there was a mode where you have a ball at the top of a tower and you have to build a path for it to get it into a pot of some sort, it can be pushed along flat and go downwards, but not up. Would be interesting to try :D
A11:09:25 <ReaperSWE> and you get points for longest distance?

A11:12:33 <Deiz> I'm thinking about how finite water should be handled
A11:12:41 <Deiz> I think there should be a sponge block of sorts
A11:12:52 <Deiz> It'd absorb a few tiles of water and then become waterlogged
A11:13:00 <Deiz> If you made space beneath it, it'd dump water into it

A11:13:49 <Deiz> An infinite water source and an infinite water remover
A11:13:54 <ReaperSWE> Water from the map bounds (infinite) flows into nearby holes to create finite-water.

A11:15:06 <ReaperSWE> finite water blocks moves to a random nearby hole, if there is a hole below it, it moves down, repeat.

A11:15:38 <ReaperSWE> water pressure?
A11:15:46 <Zuriki> Then the surrounding tiles would display stage 1 (.2 filled)
A11:16:45 <Deiz> There's a problem with that

A11:26:23 <Zuriki> No matter what you try there is no good way to simulate water in a computer program
A11:26:28 <Deiz> Will it just sit there, a cube of water, will it tool around in circles trying to find a lower point?

A11:27:29 <Deiz> Otherwise all your water sinks into the dirt
A11:27:30 <Zuriki> Maybe you're thinking into it to much
A11:27:36 <Deiz> Gets computationally expensive, fast
A11:27:38 <Zuriki> We have floating soil fgs

A11:31:35 <Notch> hehe, Haruhi2
A11:31:38 <Notch> you've got a point
A11:31:45 <Notch> but you could still build one on stilts!
A11:31:52 <ReaperSWE> \o/
A11:32:00 <iPope> you have the problem of the water randomly moving around still
A11:32:10 <ReaperSWE> if it finds a corner, stick to it.
A11:32:11 <Evil-Ville> What you need is monsters that can climb and jump high
A11:32:25 <Haruhi2> or monsters that can destroy tiles
A11:32:28 <ReaperSWE> like liquid usually does.
A11:32:29 <Deiz> iPope: "Waterlogged" copies of each tile that can absorb, I suppose
A11:32:51 <iPope> I suppose
A11:32:53 <Haruhi2> so if you make a stilt castle they could destroy the stilts and cause the castle to crash into the ground
A11:33:08 <ReaperSWE> that'd be awesome
A11:33:22 <Deiz> Notch: You could do a reachability check
A11:33:24 <Notch> 179 prepurchases. moly..
A11:33:36 <iPope> I was purchase 34 :)
A11:33:38 <ReaperSWE> *180, once paypal accepts my card.
A11:33:40 <Notch> i wonder if we'll hit 200 before the weekend is over =D
A11:33:47 <Notch> 5.5 hours to go
A11:33:51 <Deiz> Basically, simulate an AI running around for a while, and if he reaches the player it's okay
A11:33:56 <Notch> assuming an average of 4 per hour, we might juuust make it =D
A11:33:59 <ReaperSWE> over? It's Monday, 18:34 here.

13A11:34:48 * ReaperSWE feels awkward
A11:35:01 <Deiz> Minecraft faces some unique physics challenges
A11:35:04 <ReaperSWE> Go Sweden!
A11:35:09 <Deiz> Due to the large nature of individual blocks
A11:35:15 <Haruhi2> Minecraft physics should just be like DF physics
A11:35:23 <Testvan> 2d?
A11:35:25 <iPope> Notch, why don't you make water like sand?
A11:35:33 <ReaperSWE> Deiz, thing "Falling Sand game", in 3d, but with larger blocks
A11:35:38 <Notch> because you'd have huge columns of water =)
A11:35:39 <ReaperSWE> *think
A11:35:53 <Deiz> Falling Sand games are much higher resolution
A11:35:54 <iPope> Not if you make it delete the previous tile
A11:36:03 <iPope> Oh wait I see what you mean
A11:36:08 <Notch> =)
A11:36:09 <Deiz> Relatively speaking
A11:36:09 <ReaperSWE> not really,

A11:36:35 <Notch> and even if they did, they'd only be 2d interactive, not 3d.
A11:36:37 <ReaperSWE> no, but 4 million pixels ;-)
A11:36:43 <Notch> that's 2000x2000
A11:36:44 <Evil-Ville> When will you add crouching Notch
A11:36:51 <Notch> I've never seen a falling sand game that big
A11:36:58 <ReaperSWE> HAX!
A11:37:07 <iPope> I guess notch, you could amke it so that if you do have a tower of sand then it sort of flattens into a circle
A11:37:08 <Notch> Evil-Ville: I don't know if I will!
A11:37:12 <Deiz> If you had a 3D falling sand game, it'd not be hard to exceed 256x256x64
A11:37:13 <Evil-Ville> You will alright
A11:37:14 <iPope> water*
A11:37:31 <Evil-Ville> I want to have secret tunnels you have to crawl through :(
A11:37:36 <Notch> :-O
A11:37:43 <Notch> ok, ok, crawling is on the maybe list =D
A11:37:47 <Notch> the REAL maybe list
A11:37:52 <iPope> =D
A11:37:53 <Notch> not the "no, but let's say maybe to be nice" list
A11:38:02 <ReaperSWE> >:-(
A11:38:09 <Evil-Ville> Of course crawling would have to be really slow so people don't always crawl when digging
A11:38:22 <Deiz> Crawling as in make the player horizontal?

A11:38:27 <Haruhi2> multiple depths per tile for water behave better I think
A11:38:28 <ReaperSWE> you mean, making giant holes in 3 secs?
A11:38:43 <Evil-Ville> Deiz yes
A11:39:01 <smn> i'll just say 1 word and you will understand it all.
A11:39:05 <smn> binoculars.
A11:39:07 <smn> :OOOO
A11:39:12 <Deiz> Crawling > Crouching
A11:39:14 <ReaperSWE> no, magic.
A11:39:18 <Haruhi2> if you have 5 depths per water tile, then it will make a puddle of five 1-depth water at origin and in four directions
A11:39:19 <Deiz> As crouching = 1-pixel-tall character
A11:39:33 <Evil-Ville> So is crawling
A11:39:41 <ReaperSWE> crawling is 2 pixels.
A11:39:42 <Deiz> Yeah, but crawling = 2px long
A11:40:19 <Evil-Ville> Well it wouldn't matter much how long you are
A11:40:26 <Deiz> It would
A11:40:37 <Deiz> You'd need 2x2 to turn around if you were 2x1x1
A11:40:54 <Notch> yes. =)
A11:41:03 <Notch> if I added crawling, you'd be unable to turn around in narrow passages. =D
A11:41:23 <Notch> it'd probably be very claustrophobic =D
A11:41:26 <Notch> and quite possibly very confusing
A11:41:29 <Evil-Ville> this hole, it was made for me
A11:41:33 <Notch> argh
13A11:41:37 * Notch drrrr

A11:42:32 <Evil-Ville> ReaperSWE as if it would be any easier than doing it currently
A11:42:40 <Syniphas> hey Notch?
A11:42:43 <Deiz> All of your durrs are missing U's
A11:42:48 <Sonict> As long as there is a compass so you have a sense of direction in the game, that will help me and other people too when they want you to help them and you can't find them since you have no sense of direction. :)
A11:43:03 <Deiz> YES.
A11:43:05 <Syniphas> thanks for showing off the skinning feature with a "BUY PLZ" message
A11:43:05 <ReaperSWE> build a landmark, stay above ground ;-)

A11:52:48 <Syniphas> "You have to buy the game to change skins" or something
A11:53:11 <Deiz> Syniphas: It could be rephrased.
A11:53:22 <Syniphas> It's not the phrase
A11:53:29 <Deiz> "You have a face only a mother could love. Pay €10 to change your hideous face."

P12:33:21 <Eagle> That would actually make a nice enemy
P12:33:42 <Zuriki> Like the tileset I did as well?
P12:33:47 <Eagle> I haven't seen it.
P12:33:55 <Zuriki> It's on that picture
P12:34:01 <Zuriki> Snow land
P12:34:16 <Eagle> Oh
P12:34:25 <Zuriki> Instead of the little plant things, there is snowballs
P12:34:25 <Eagle> ha didn't notice the background
P12:34:28 <Zuriki> :]
P12:34:35 <Eagle> XD
P12:34:48 <Zuriki> They look quite good.
P12:35:04 <Zuriki> I tried presents and piles of snow before it, but those didn't work well.
P12:35:13 <Zuriki> I was thinking of changing it to little snowmen
P12:35:15 <Parthon> how did you do a tileset?
P12:35:28 <Zuriki> Edit the JAR file

P12:36:07 <Zuriki> If you look on the forums (Future of Minecraft) there is a wasteland tileset I did

P12:37:05 <citricsquid> wow, I can just about manage 1 hour of work a week before getting distracted :(
P12:37:09 <Parthon> that means I'm on track-ish :P
P12:37:18 <Notch> haha, nice troll
P12:37:30 <Zuriki> I have Sheik from Zelda too
P12:37:36 <Notch> those 80 hours include chatting here and "playtesting"
P12:37:37 <Zuriki> And a nice hut with a picture on the wall
P12:37:46 <Notch> "playtesting" in that sense is mostly just goofing around, though. ;)

P12:37:51 <Notch> nice troll. Scary =D
P12:38:11 <Zuriki> ^-^
P12:38:18 <Zuriki> I can has free minecraft nao?
P12:38:22 <Notch> just 15 more registrations and we're at 200 :D
P12:38:36 <Parthon> purchase or registrations?
P12:38:41 <Notch> purchase, sorry
P12:38:49 <Daz> Going well :o
P12:38:53 <Parthon> did you expect this to be so successful?
P12:38:53 <Notch> oh, wow almost 10000 registered as well
P12:39:02 <Notch> no, parthon..
P12:39:09 <Notch> I'm extremely motivated now

P12:39:25 <Testvan> nothing like money to motivate
P12:39:28 <Notch> yeah, daz, about that
P12:39:29 <Parthon> I give you premission to take a holiday, until you hit 200 or 10k :D

P12:39:52 <citricsquid> I love the forums; "omg omg minecraft will die who will preorder this?!" and it's at 200 already.
P12:40:01 <Notch> i need a better custom skin
P12:40:12 <akuryo> nack
P12:40:13 <akuryo> everyone
P12:40:15 <akuryo> back
P12:40:16 <Notch> i wasn't clear enough on the site that I was going to charge. :-(
P12:40:17 <Parthon> I'm technically paying for the 40 hours of time I've already gotten out of it
P12:40:22 <Parthon> future updates are just bonuses :D
P12:40:26 <Lmaoboat> I'm thinking in survival, walls should be damagable by enemies, so building in more dangerous areas needs better materials. I think it would be awsome having an advanced base deep underground surrorunded by lava zombies. You could have mushrooms, or crops in a greenhouse growing forfood.
P12:40:32 <Deiz> Notch: Can you list what servers use name verification on the serverlist?
P12:40:39 <Deiz> I'd like to fill in some ceilings with the Notchbot
P12:40:39 <Notch> i was clear on irc from day one whenever it came up
P12:40:39 <Zuriki> Notchy
P12:40:46 <Zuriki> I'll make you a custom skin if you want :]
P12:40:54 <Parthon> Deiz: that would be a bad idea probably
P12:40:56 <akuryo> Deiz
P12:40:58 <akuryo> NotchBot?
P12:41:00 <Notch> Deiz: That's probably a bad idea. ;)
P12:41:01 <Parthon> the ones without it would become grief bait?
P12:41:04 <Notch> Zuriki: I'd love it. =D
P12:41:05 <Deiz> Notch: It's a fun idea.
P12:41:10 <Zuriki> What do you want?
P12:41:14 <akuryo> Deiz?
P12:41:25 <Notch> can I get a bearded bald dwarven type with big black boots?
P12:41:26 <Deiz> akuryo: That's a bot, using Notch's username/skin
P12:41:38 <akuryo> lol
P12:41:41 <akuryo> you developped it?
P12:41:42 <Zuriki> Yeah
P12:41:48 <Deiz> No
P12:41:50 <Deiz> zid developed it
P12:41:51 <Zuriki> If I can add a beard?
P12:41:51 <citricsquid> I don't see why anyone would disprove of charging, it's a brilliant game and well worth $15 for the ~10 hours I've played.
P12:41:53 <Parthon> Notch: have you thought about custom models?
13P12:42:01 * zid waves
P12:42:07 <Notch> Parthon: Some, and I'm leaning towards not having it
P12:42:11 <akuryo> WAIT
P12:42:12 <Parthon> cool
P12:42:14 <akuryo> models are not custom?
P12:42:18 <akuryo> you have to choose?
P12:42:25 <Notch> I'm going to have visible armor and weapons in survival
P12:42:32 <Notch> and those wouldn't fit well on custom models
P12:42:37 <Notch> akuryo: There's just one model :-O
P12:42:40 <Notch> the skin is custom, though
P12:42:44 <Parthon> are they skeleton animated?
P12:42:50 <Notch> no, not even close. =D
P12:42:50 <akuryo> wait
P12:42:52 <Parthon> aaah of course
P12:42:59 <Parthon> frame animated?
P12:43:01 <Deiz> Notch: Limit neck angle
P12:43:10 <Deiz> Otherwise it can end up in the torso

P12:43:22 <Notch> Deiz: haha, yeah
P12:43:25 <Parthon> :o
P12:43:26 <Notch> I kinda like it being this silly
P12:43:30 <Parthon> you mean it's 4 different blocks?
P12:43:31 <Notch> but I can fix it if it bothers people
P12:43:37 <Zuriki> Crud
P12:43:42 <Notch> huh Parthon?
P12:43:42 <Deiz> Well
P12:43:47 <Zuriki> I haven't got the original character texture
P12:43:49 <Zuriki> :P
P12:43:52 <Deiz> The head should also bobble sideways when running
P12:43:56 <Deiz> In sync with the arm flailing
P12:43:57 <Parthon> like, you render the parts of the model seperately?
P12:43:57 <Notch> it's on /skin/
P12:44:16 <Notch> yes, parthon. It's just six parts, so it's cheap. =)
P12:44:20 <Zuriki> I haven't bought the game though
P12:44:24 <Parthon> that's awesome
P12:44:29 <Notch> ohh..

P12:45:16 <Notch> Parthon: No, I'm doing things the way that's easiest for me
P12:45:23 <Notch> I like procedural content, so I'm using that a lot
P12:45:24 <Deiz> Notch: I lied. Inefficient.
P12:45:31 <Deiz> I saved 14.19% by running optipng on that :p
P12:45:36 <Notch> wow
P12:45:41 <Zuriki> I hate doing procedural content

P12:46:33 <Deiz> Minecraft models should be cake to make
P12:46:40 <Notch> like a basic humanoid one for goblins and trolls and whatnot, and an.. uh.. what's the name for the not humanoid ones? heh
P12:46:43 <Deiz> Due to their being extremely low-poly
P12:46:59 <Parthon> bipedal creatures and quadrapedal ones? :D
P12:47:01 <Notch> oh yeah Deiz.. I just use ImageIO on the server
P12:47:06 <Gauphastus> Bears and deer.
P12:47:09 <Gauphastus> :P
P12:47:12 <Notch> yeah parton
P12:47:20 <Deiz> What?
P12:47:23 <Deiz> I want some tripedal stuff
P12:47:31 <Notch> then just say "bear = buildQuadraped(Shape.FAT)"
P12:47:32 <Notch> or something
P12:47:52 <Notch> quad raped?
P12:47:55 <Gauphastus> I'd like to be able to go "Oh, shit! A bear!" and run away because those things are savage one on one.
P12:48:09 <Notch> yeah, they should be =D
P12:48:10 <Gauphastus> I would know.
P12:48:13 <Gauphastus> >.>
P12:48:16 <Gauphastus> But no.
P12:48:20 <Gauphastus> How about fish?
P12:48:27 <Gauphastus> Little fishies in the water.
P12:48:32 <Notch> possibly. =D
P12:48:35 <Gauphastus> Like in RTS games, they can run out after awhile.
P12:48:49 <Gauphastus> Either stab them with spears or drain out the water. :P
P12:49:20 <Gauphastus> I don't know how you're gonna set this up, but I'm personally not a fan of the loading bar to perform skills.

P12:49:39 <Gauphastus> So if you could ever squeeze in a minigame for crafting, that'd be awesome.
P12:49:42 <Gauphastus> But whatever.
P12:49:54 <iPope> crafting would be cool
P12:49:59 <Notch> I think crafting will probably be instantaneous as long as you have the resources
P12:50:00 <Gauphastus> I'm having some sausages and fried eggs for breakfast.
P12:50:08 <Notch> there might be some waiting time when smelting and so
P12:50:08 <Gauphastus> That's alright too.
P12:50:24 <Gauphastus> One thing I thought would be cool is starting off with basic seeds like.. potatoes.
P12:50:30 <Notch> yeah =D
P12:50:39 <Gauphastus> But then you go out into the wilderness and find much nicer stuff.
P12:50:40 <iPope> Notch I had the idea that you would need to drink during the day, and you needed to fill up cups and bottles with water
P12:51:02 <iPope> Or you could drink straight from a water source, though could risk piosoning
P12:51:09 <iPope> (exscuse spelling)
P12:51:12 <Gauphastus> Did you ever play Stranded 2?
P12:51:17 <Notch> i haven't yet
P12:51:22 <Notch> i'm not sure about drinking water
P12:51:23 <Gauphastus> Though you've heard of it?
P12:51:34 <Notch> i got shown it. =)
P12:51:38 <Gauphastus> It's fun.
P12:51:44 <Gauphastus> I like shooting down parrots with arrows.
P12:51:46 <Notch> i should animate the water and lava textures
P12:51:57 <Parthon> that would be epic
P12:52:18 <Parthon> you know what would also be epic?
P12:52:26 <iPope> and have crashing waves near the beach

P12:52:34 <iPope> and normal waves out at sea
P12:52:37 <Parthon> dynamically procedurally updating the lava/water texture per frame
P12:52:46 <zid> Notch: why is my bot so much slower when I run it to fill walls rather than the ceiling
P12:52:53 <zid> and by y I mean depth, z to the rest of us
P12:53:00 <Syniphas> Notch
P12:53:05 <Syniphas> instead of animating it
P12:53:14 <Syniphas> how about a pulsing glow for the lava
P12:53:21 <Parthon> same thing
P12:53:30 <Parthon> at least technical wise
P12:53:38 <Syniphas> not entirely
P12:53:42 <iPope> glow would be cool
P12:53:44 <Parthon> art wise, different
P12:53:51 <Parthon> he's putting light sources in too
P12:53:52 <Syniphas> since you wouldn't be animating the tile itself
P12:53:57 <Gauphastus> By the way, the teleport command is super useful.
P12:54:06 <Gauphastus> I've nailed like ten griefers today.
P12:54:15 <Syniphas> anyways, for the water, some "bloom"-like effect
P12:54:24 <Syniphas> not actually bloom, but just so you know what I mean
P12:54:25 <Parthon> bloom?
P12:54:30 <Parthon> foadiaf :D
P12:54:32 <Syniphas> yeah like
P12:54:35 <Syniphas> what
P12:54:37 <Parthon> but in a nice way
P12:54:43 <Syniphas> like
P12:54:53 <iPope> what about a swamp tile
P12:54:54 <Syniphas> make the water kinda glow, but just the highlights
P12:55:06 <Parthon> aaah
P12:55:49 <iPope> similiar to lava just on the surface near ponds and stuff. diff texture and a dull green when underneath
P12:57:04 <Deiz> Notch: Chat timestamps would be nice
P12:57:37 <Deiz> Unlike everything else, they'd be done serverside :p

P2:15:38 <DeathsBrother> We REALLY need e-mail activation, and one account per email.

P2:18:25 <zid> six billion? that's more than there are IPv4 address, way to fail at pulling numbers out of your ass

P2:18:44 <Syniphas> IPv6 is a myth

P6:57:02 <zid> anything you can send me a 256x256 2 colour image of
P6:57:16 <DeathsBrother> Would it be possible to just do a full-clear of the map?
P6:57:21 <DeathsBrother> Eg: remove every block
P6:57:22 <zid> every level?
P6:57:24 <Gauphastus> That's pretty crazy.
P6:57:24 <zid> sure
P6:57:32 <DeathsBrother> Does it speed up the client, or use teleportation?
P6:57:40 <zid> it doesn't do anything to the client
P6:57:44 <DeathsBrother> Neat.
P6:57:47 <DeathsBrother> Packet editing?
P6:57:50 <zid> no
P6:57:54 <zid> it doesn't do anything to the client
P6:57:57 <zid> my phone could do it
P6:58:06 <DeathsBrother> Que?
P6:58:07 <zid> it's a valid client for the game, just not the java one
P6:58:17 <DeathsBrother> Ah.
P6:58:23 <zid> written from scratch
P6:58:28 <DeathsBrother> Nice.
P6:58:40 <zid> deiz was my guinnea pig for figuring out the protocol so I gave him skybot
P6:58:44 <zid> the one that fills the sky in
P6:58:47 <DeathsBrother> How complex of creations can it go?
P6:59:04 <zid> I could fill the entire map with a 256*256*64 3D model
P6:59:21 <zid> I wrote my name around the top edge of an entire map yesterday :P
P6:59:38 <zid> filled all the edges in for Testvan for his space theme
P6:59:42 <zid> dragons on the sky
P6:59:49 <zid> teleport to people and delete the blocks under them
P7:00:00 <zid> anti-block removal
P7:00:06 <DeathsBrother> Anti-block removal?
P7:00:08 <zid> he teleports to the removed block and fills it back in
P7:00:12 <DeathsBrother> Oic.
P7:00:13 <Gauphastus> There is a bot named foobar running around but he doesn't seem to be doing anything.
P7:00:14 <DeathsBrother> Nice.
P7:00:18 <Gauphastus> Maybe it's complete?
P7:00:24 <zid> Gauphastus: that's my bot
P7:00:29 <Gauphastus> Alright.
P7:00:31 <zid> Gauphastus: d6cb517f0027217fca5f95f29df6bf6c is your server?
P7:00:33 <Gauphastus> Should I kick him out?
P7:00:36 <Gauphastus> Yeah, that's mine.
P7:00:56 <DeathsBrother> I have no ideas what to build.
P7:01:07 <Gauphastus> Well, cool. Thank you.
P7:01:08 <DeathsBrother> So I'm just staring at the big 'HEZZY LOVES COCK' sign in my server.
P7:01:20 <zid> did he finish drawing?
P7:01:23 <zid> I can't see i'm banned
P7:01:28 <DeathsBrother> I'll un-ban.
P7:01:33 <DeathsBrother> Done.
P7:01:59 <DeathsBrother> And theres a giant phallus in the sky.
P7:02:07 <zid> Just the way you like it
P7:02:13 <DeathsBrother> And a HEZZY <3's GAYRY sign.
P7:02:20 <DeathsBrother> Silly facepunch.
P7:02:39 <DeathsBrother> You're unbanned, zid.
P7:02:44 <zid> yea, you said
P7:03:58 <DeathsBrother> So, how does the bot work, exactly?
P7:04:22 <zid> Just acts like a normal client

P7:05:06 <zid> the server allows teleporting, press r
P7:05:20 <DeathsBrother> Never thought of that.
P7:05:39 <DeathsBrother> Sends a packet saying 'new spawn point is here'
P7:05:43 <DeathsBrother> Auto-presses r
P7:05:45 <DeathsBrother> creates block
P7:05:48 <DeathsBrother> sends packet again

P7:07:18 <DeathsBrother> Would prevent most griefers.
P7:07:29 <humpolec> why is minecraft hogging 100% cpu?
P7:07:30 <Gauphastus> Yeah, email verification slows them down.
P7:07:33 <DeathsBrother> Mhm.

P7:08:51 <humpolec> zid: makes sense... but how do i get java to vsync?
P7:08:56 <zid> NUM4 liked my dragon
P7:09:00 <DeathsBrother> Just vsync your desktop
P7:09:11 <zid> humpolec: java can only update the screen as fast as your screen updates, if your desktop is vsync'd it'll cap to 60fps
P7:09:17 <zid> unless you're gettng lower than that, of course
P7:09:24 <DeathsBrother> Anything beyond 60 fps is barely noticable.
P7:09:37 <zid> My monitor is 52Hz :P

P7:11:48 <DeathsBrother> Me and some friends
P7:11:49 <DeathsBrother> Found out
P7:11:53 <DeathsBrother> That you can destroy blocks.
P7:11:58 <DeathsBrother> By sending packet information.
P7:12:03 <DeathsBrother> But not outside the radius normally
P7:12:17 <DeathsBrother> But, you could make a 7x7x7 wide area of destruction each key-press.

P9:05:37 <prakCurie> I believe that was Wurm before Rolf got involved.  Please correct me if I am wrong.
P9:06:06 <Imapanda> Know what would be awesome?
P9:06:10 <Imapanda> Wurm with the source engine.
P9:06:14 <Dickbutt> WHen they made home servers for subscribers only the game got killed
P9:06:15 <Imapanda> Sweetness.
P9:06:17 <Dickbutt> SOurce engine no

P9:06:37 <Dickbutt> You wouldnt be able to build houses
P9:06:40 <Dickbutt> Hmm
P9:06:49 <prakCurie> Or modify the landscape.
P9:06:50 <Imapanda> Source seems so fluent and flexible
P9:06:53 <Eagle> There's no way that would work, as the source engine can only hold like 1000 entities in one map.
P9:07:10 <Dickbutt> It would probbably have to be custom made
P9:07:32 <Imapanda> Well, they update source after every major game they make.
P9:07:39 <Imapanda> somewhat.
P9:07:51 <prakCurie> I any case, I'm here in hopes he makes something like Wurm without the crazy management.  Or a multiplayer DF.
P9:07:52 <Dickbutt> They cant do source forever
P9:08:01 <Dickbutt> its somewhat outdated as it is
P9:08:22 <Imapanda> They've been using source since 2003. It's been a while.
P9:09:12 <Imapanda> I mean, any newer game like wurm would be awesome.
P9:10:04 <prakCurie> What do you think Source is going to be able to do for Wurm exactly?
P9:10:36 <Dickbutt> Nothing
P9:10:39 <Dickbutt> :D
P9:10:49 <Dickbutt> Physhics are sub-par imo
P9:11:03 <Dickbutt> Graphics to
P9:11:18 <prakCurie> 32 player Wurm?
P9:11:28 <Dickbutt> 1 KM Map
P9:11:32 <Dickbutt> Hah
P9:11:33 <Imapanda> Whatabout unreal?
P9:11:48 <Dickbutt> I doubt it
P9:11:58 <Dickbutt> Its an FPS engine
P9:12:04 <Dickbutt> err
P9:12:05 <Dickbutt> Well
P9:12:10 <Imapanda> Wurm is an FPS.
P9:12:12 <Imapanda> Sorta.
P9:12:19 <Dickbutt> First Person Shooter?
P9:12:24 <Imapanda> Arrows?
P9:12:25 <Imapanda> iunno.
P9:12:29 <Dickbutt> ..
P9:12:48 <Dickbutt> It would have to be a new engine
P9:12:50 <Imapanda> It still follows the same basic aspects of some FPS's.
P9:12:59 <Imapanda> Yeah.
P9:13:05 <prakCurie> You really might want to do some research into the limitation of the various engines.

P9:13:31 <Imapanda> I'm just dreaming about it, not really saying it's a possibility.
P9:13:39 <Imapanda> I'm saying IF is was possible.
P9:13:42 <Imapanda> It would be awesome.
P9:14:06 <prakCurie> Why?
P9:14:11 <Dickbutt> Anyway
P9:14:22 <Dickbutt> Im sure most of the engines are limted to small maps that load
P9:14:27 <Dickbutt> Like X-Ray
P9:14:28 <Dickbutt> Unreal
P9:14:31 <Dickbutt> Source
P9:14:52 <prakCurie> Slightly improved graphics?  It is so far from possible at to not even make the smallest amount of sense to dream about it.
P9:15:14 <prakCurie> Thus my confusion.
P9:16:05 <Imapanda> It's just I often get lost in the clunkiness of wurm.
P9:16:12 <DeathsBrother> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=8ddcd3905567acb4cda924f2ccc8f926
P9:16:16 <DeathsBrother> Someone come join
P9:16:17 <DeathsBrother> :D
P9:16:18 <Imapanda> server?
P9:16:22 <Imapanda> which on?
P9:16:24 <Imapanda> one*
P9:16:30 <DeathsBrother> A private.
P9:16:40 <Imapanda> It's purple, means I been on it.
P9:16:41 <FoxBlitzz> I'm not a fan of Unreal Engine. Bulky, isn't at all prolific
P9:16:48 <FoxBlitzz> And version 3 is really a mess
P9:16:51 <Imapanda> What's the server name?
P9:17:13 <Imapanda> Oh facepunch.
P9:17:20 <Imapanda> Yeah, I'm a big member on FP.
P9:17:35 <Imapanda> Gpot a few thousand posts, been a member since 06.
P9:17:42 <FoxBlitzz> Why not just use a simpler solution?
P9:18:00 <Imapanda> Personally I'm following the goons on Minecraft.
P9:18:09 <Imapanda> Much cleaner servers.
P9:18:21 <FoxBlitzz> Using OGRE or Irrlicht would allow for a much more flexible system
P9:18:53 <Imapanda> crytek? :3
P9:18:59 <FoxBlitzz> You are looking at big-name FPS engines. Those kinda of systems would hardly be ideal for dynamic terrain
P9:19:03 <FoxBlitzz> Oh God no
P9:19:05 <Imapanda> Lol.
P9:19:06 <FoxBlitzz> Not Crytek
P9:19:10 <DeathsBrother> lol
P9:19:49 <Imapanda> DeathsBrother, what's your FP name?
P9:19:51 <FoxBlitzz> Seriously, go OGRE and learn C++
P9:20:12 <FoxBlitzz> More work probably, but you'll also be far more likely to churn out a workable result
P9:20:34 <FoxBlitzz> Your system will be portable and unencumbered by licensing issues

P11:32:42 <notjotham> whutt
P11:32:47 <notjotham> y is right
P11:33:13 <paul|not> the vertical axis
P11:33:18 <Eagle> z is up and down in a 3D plane
P11:33:25 <paul|not> I guess it is 30
P11:33:25 <notjotham> uhm
P11:33:29 <Eagle> y is forward and back
P11:33:33 <Eagle> x is left and right
P11:33:38 <notjotham> as a programmer, graphics programmer
P11:33:39 <paul|not> anyways I have my answer so
P11:33:42 <notjotham> i have to say there is either miscommunication here
P11:33:44 <notjotham> or you are a crackhead
P11:33:55 <Jeramy> Z is front to back, i thought
P11:34:00 <notjotham> http://www.whiterockscience.com/moritz/axis_3d.html
P11:34:02 <Eagle> http://wiki.guildwars.com/images/thumb/f/fb/Z_axis.jpg/300px-Z_axis.jpg
P11:34:18 <notjotham> guild wars isn't a scientific reference
P11:34:22 <notjotham> that image is wrong
P11:34:28 <Eagle> Just google imaged it
P11:34:41 <Eagle> http://www.we-r-here.com/cad/tutorials/level_3/images/xyz_axes.gif
P11:34:42 <notjotham> Y is up, like it is in 2D
P11:34:50 <notjotham> in 3D the 'depth' (forward/back) becomes the new metric Z
P11:34:59 <notjotham> while X remains left/right and Y remains up/down
P11:35:32 <Eagle> http://www.labotex.com/osie1.gif
P11:35:38 <Eagle> Just throwing out images here.
P11:35:56 <notjotham> right, ultimately, like origins, it's a matter of preference
P11:36:01 <notjotham> but the standard is for z to be depth
P11:36:04 <notjotham> for the reason i gave above
P11:36:25 <Eagle> You told me I was wrong, and now you're saying it's all opinion?
P11:36:31 <notjotham> i think you are wrong
P11:36:35 <notjotham> because it goes against convention
P11:36:41 <Eagle> I just gave like 3 pictures
P11:36:54 <notjotham> but i will accept fundimentally there is no scientific reason for the labeling system that we use in CG as normal
P11:37:01 <notjotham> like screen coordinate origins
P11:37:25 <notjotham> so i think you are wrong, but there isn't a scientific argument for why you are wrong, it's just what is accepted usage
P11:37:42 <paul|not> I think notch goes by how DF does it
P11:37:49 <Eagle> I'm going to math websites and their graphs aren't showing in your favor... >>;
P11:37:53 <paul|not> as in we assume a topdown perspective when labeling axes
P11:38:09 <notjotham> well math and computer graphics are seperate things
P11:38:23 <notjotham> they have some overlap in comp sci of course
P11:38:25 <Eagle> That makes no sense.
P11:38:29 <notjotham> but they have their own policies of what is 'normal'
P11:38:30 <Eagle> Why is this
P11:38:42 <paul|not> man
P11:38:48 <paul|not> circlebuild 64 is going to wear me the fuck out
P11:38:52 <Jeramy> Scentifically speaking, Z is front to back, relative to the viewer, no matter which way the viewer is facing
P11:38:55 <notjotham> because when you have arbitrary things, like label conventions, different communities form different standards
P11:38:58 <notjotham> this is entirely sensible
P11:39:14 <notjotham> it's very normal for Z to be used to modify the Y and X, thus being the 'depth' element
P11:39:18 <notjotham> in CG
P11:39:27 <Eagle> Well, the whole slightly different things call for completely contrasting measures
P11:39:29 <Eagle> makes no sense
P11:40:00 <Jeramy> For the sake of Minecraft, Z should be the vertical axis
P11:40:08 <Parthon> just to clear things up, Notch uses Y for depth :P
P11:40:23 <notjotham> usually something like projected_x = x/z*depth
P11:40:33 <Parthon> or height
P11:40:37 <Eagle> Depth in which direction? Levels or from the mob's perspective
P11:40:46 <Parthon> the level
P11:40:48 <notjotham> depth when considering 2D as the previous known-state
P11:40:53 <Eagle> Like DF?
P11:41:04 <Eagle> Oh, right.
P11:41:14 <notjotham> it makes sense for DF to use Z to mean elevation, since it was originally 2D
P11:41:46 <Eagle> I wasn't basing it off DF, I was comparing. >>;
P11:42:00 <Jeramy> the viewer is looking down in DF, so the Z axis would naturally be up and down
P11:42:10 <Jeramy> in minecraft, you arent looking down
P11:42:16 <Jeramy> (usually)
P11:42:22 <Eagle> Yes, I agree. I wasn't saying that.
P11:42:37 <Eagle> I was just comparing to DF for ease.
P11:42:37 <notjotham> it's just based on convention or environmental constraint
P11:42:42 <paul|not> yeah spherebuild is goan be oh jesus hard
P11:43:13 <notjotham> like the difference between the origin in ogl and dx
