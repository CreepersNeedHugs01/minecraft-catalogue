P5:06:53 <KEROLiUKAS> ohai dibbin, you here too?

P5:07:04 <KEROLiUKAS> ergh, havent used java in like ever... links for any?
P5:07:16 <Thi3f> http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml
P5:07:22 <Zolyx> nn, Minecrafters - have fun
P5:07:24 <Riobe1> DBN: Did you get the latest zip frile?
11P5:07:27 <DBN> yes
P5:07:28 <Riobe1> file*
P5:07:29 <Thi3f> Underneath "Test your JVM" there's an applet

P5:07:39 <Riobe1> You've set up port forwarding?
11P5:07:49 <DBN> the central server is sending me my external ip
11P5:07:59 <DBN> which i can't connect to from inside my own network
P5:08:03 <Riobe1> You have more than one servers?
P5:08:08 <Thi3f> Have you tried using 127.0.0.1?
11P5:08:15 <DBN> i can't specify an ip
P5:08:17 <KEROLiUKAS> it's not localhost for him
P5:08:22 <Thi3f> Oh

P5:08:44 <Thi3f> Then use the LAN IP?
P5:08:58 <KEROLiUKAS> anyways, http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml works perfectly.
11P5:09:04 <DBN> the new connection urls are just an ID
11P5:09:07 <DBN> no ip/port
P5:09:12 <KEROLiUKAS> ^
P5:09:15 <Riobe1> Hmm..
P5:09:24 <Riobe1> I'm not sure.
10P5:09:24 * Mode (GrabPEELS@bas1-windsor12-1088733962.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
P5:09:25 <Thi3f> KEROLiUKAS, and what version is your java?
P5:09:30 <KEROLiUKAS> just updated it..
P5:09:40 <Thi3f> Alright
P5:09:48 <KEROLiUKAS> 1.6.0.13
P5:09:50 <Thi3f> Running windows?
10P5:09:53 * Riobe1 (Admin@c-24-13-88-153.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
P5:09:59 <KEROLiUKAS> yea, vista x64
P5:10:05 <KEROLiUKAS> I guess you just found my problem
P5:10:05 <KEROLiUKAS> xD
P5:10:12 <KEROLiUKAS> Windows :D
P5:10:23 <Thi3f> Haha, naw, I just wanted to make sure before I told you to visit the control panel :P
P5:10:39 <Thi3f> In the control panel there's a panel for Java
P5:10:41 <Tim> i'm running it on vista 64 it works perfect
10P5:10:52 * Furkle (furkle@bas4-stcatharines10-1279604388.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
P5:11:01 <Thi3f> Under the advanced tab and Troubleshooting or Debug or something, there's a box to enable logging
11P5:11:01 <DBN> is the dev here?
P5:11:12 <Tim> notch?
P5:11:13 <Thi3f> DBN, don't think so
P5:11:13 <KEROLiUKAS> yea just found that.
P5:11:16 <Tim> no
P5:11:17 <Furkle> anyone else tried to run the server off windows 7?
P5:11:42 <Thi3f> Now uh, I've forgotten where the log normally goes though
P5:12:54 <Thi3f> Perhaps somewhere in the Program Files\Java\Something\Somethingelse
P5:13:11 <Thi3f> Anyhow, check the log if it says something unusual after freezing your browser
10P5:14:09 * Stargoat (Stuie@220-244-161-193.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
P5:15:15 <KEROLiUKAS> damn u java
P5:15:45 <KEROLiUKAS> it freezes at a weird point.
P5:16:04 <Thi3f> I suppose you can't reach the java console before it freezes?
P5:16:31 <KEROLiUKAS> no I can reach it, but that froze too now and I am unable to see it, hold on, maybe I can take a screenshot
P5:16:43 <KEROLiUKAS> it said smthg about Warning, unknown version of windows, windows vista
P5:16:46 <KEROLiUKAS> using default windows plugin
P5:17:34 <Thi3f> Hmm, I don't suppose you're running 64-bit java in x86 IE though, right?
10P5:17:49 * TrueWolves (masterofth@69-176-226-109.static.izoom.net) has joined #minecraft
P5:17:52 <Syniphas> hey giver
P5:18:00 <KEROLiUKAS> I am testing in firefox and chrome
P5:18:10 <Syniphas> can you tell me how the level structure is formed?
P5:18:11 <KEROLiUKAS> did not try IE after updating java.
P5:18:15 <Syniphas> I wanna give it a shot
P5:18:26 <Thi3f> Yeah, but either way, running 64 bit java in x86 browser can yield some weird results
P5:18:30 <Thi3f> Or no results at all
P5:18:44 <KEROLiUKAS> I think my java is x86
P5:18:58 <KEROLiUKAS> crap it doesn't say
P5:19:19 <Thi3f> And there's another thing you can try
P5:19:22 <Thi3f> If the java control panel
P5:19:46 <Thi3f> Under Advanced tab, and then Java Plug-in -> Activate next generation something something, uncheck that and see if it helps
P5:20:25 <KEROLiUKAS> tried it
P5:20:28 <KEROLiUKAS> no good
P5:21:53 <Thi3f> Well, I'm out of ideas
P5:21:54 <Thi3f> ¯\(°_o)/¯

P5:51:38 <kingnerd> Hey guys... Can we maybe get this game working on Linux?  I tried on Debian and Ubuntu, both no-gos.
P5:52:22 <KEROLiUKAS> it's java I dont see why not
P5:52:45 <kingnerd> neither do I... The loading / downloading work fine, but when they are done, I get a black screen, which upon clicking becomes a white screen.
P5:52:57 <kingnerd> This is both in Epiphany and Firefox (admittedly both Gecko browsers)
P5:53:04 <kingnerd> Shouldn't make a difference though
P5:54:25 <kingnerd> about to try it in Opera under VirtualBox
P5:55:30 <paul|not> don't use opera
P5:55:39 <paul|not> or at least don't switch tabs
P5:55:40 <paul|not> if you do
P5:56:09 <kingnerd> it's in a virtualbox.. Testing is the only reason I'm using it, so I don't have more than 1 tab

P6:01:36 <dropshock0> Ok thanks

P10:02:28 <Testvan> i keep joining MP servers to find something epic i am always disapointed
P10:03:07 <TrueWolves> I saw something epic once, but it was greifed, it did give the whole place a distorted ruins look, if it was sad how much was distroyed
P10:03:18 <vdgmprgrmr> Testvan, make your own server.
P10:03:48 <vdgmprgrmr> Then you can organize a team of epic-construction-builders.
P10:04:34 <vdgmprgrmr> Also, that castle is making me cry.
P10:05:01 <Deiz> It would be better as a wholly underground cave
P10:05:07 <Deiz> Because then it wouldn't MURDER your FPS
P10:06:17 <Syniphas> Okay wtf
P10:06:20 <Syniphas> Even as an mp3
P10:06:32 <Syniphas> On audacity it plays fine
P10:06:40 <Testvan> i dont catter to crap copmuters
P10:07:00 <Deiz> Testvan: MURDER is relative. I get 600-700 FPS normally
P10:07:01 <vdgmprgrmr> Whoa never thought of trying to play Hide-and-seek in MC.
P10:07:06 <Deiz> With your castle, I'm down to ~100
P10:07:19 <Testvan> i limit my FPS to 60 to not waste power
P10:07:27 <vdgmprgrmr> With your castle, it stays about normal in maps of that size...
P10:07:29 <vdgmprgrmr> 0.
P10:07:42 <vdgmprgrmr> Less than one frame per second.
P10:07:48 <Testvan> well go in the castle, will increase your FPS
P10:07:56 <TrueWolves> I turn on f
P10:11:05 <vdgmprgrmr> I press F twice and everything runs fine usually, but it sucks not being able to see everything.
P10:12:17 <TrueWolves> About the same thing I got to do
P10:12:40 <mezo> wanna make a deathstar testvan
P10:12:56 <Testvan> i know not how to make round things with square things

P10:18:33 <pyl> Testvan: hate to break it to you, but pretty much every round thing that is computer related is made with square things :]
P10:19:02 <Testvan> so
P10:19:18 <Testvan> i know not how to make them, i know other people do
P10:19:28 <pyl> oh
P10:19:31 <pyl> right
P10:19:46 <ItzMattu> vdgmprgrmr: I am going to work on some scripts and website stuff too eventually probably
P10:19:56 <ItzMattu> I am just too busy working on a game right now
P10:20:08 <vdgmprgrmr> The effect can easily be achieved if you know how to calculate the distance from a point in 3d space.
P10:20:10 <ItzMattu> And other things I was occupied with prior to setting up Minecraft servers
P10:20:21 <vdgmprgrmr> After that it's just work.
P10:20:27 <ItzMattu> pyl: Would you consider sharing your scripts that you are using for a website?
P10:20:55 <ItzMattu> If you do, and if I end up making some PHP stuff to edit admin/banned lists via  a website, i will gladly pass those along.
P10:21:14 <ItzMattu> I am considering doing a whole appeals system and whatnot as well in time.
P10:21:34 <ItzMattu> I would work with you on them too if you know PHP
P10:22:52 <pyl> ItzMattu: maybe when they're actually worth something, sure. what you're doing is a lot more elaborate than what i'm planning though
P10:23:13 <ItzMattu> Well I would like a list of admin/banned/chat log thing for a site too
P10:23:19 <ItzMattu> And if I can skip the work that would be awesome
P10:23:23 <ItzMattu> What did you write them in?
P10:23:30 <pyl> my stuff is all cgi-scripts and bash :]
P10:23:33 <ItzMattu> And mostly... how did you get a chatlog onto a website?
P10:23:53 <ItzMattu> I wouldn't know how to get the chatlog from the server since it just spams it on the screen while the java is running.
P10:24:05 <ItzMattu> And there is no output of the log as far as I can tell...
P10:24:16 <pyl> of course it outputs
P10:24:19 <pyl> you said it yourself
P10:24:21 <pyl> it spams the screen
P10:24:25 <ItzMattu> Well yeah
P10:24:39 <ItzMattu> But how did you grab that? You can't do anything in that console while it is runing the server
P10:24:43 <ItzMattu> running*
P10:25:03 <pyl> i can't?
P10:25:12 <pyl> it's stderr
P10:25:14 <pyl> i just redirect it
P10:25:16 <ItzMattu> Yeah
P10:25:21 <ItzMattu> Is that << or something?
P10:25:27 <pyl> &>
P10:25:42 <ItzMattu> So you jsut do the normal java comand line and then at the end do &> log.txt
P10:25:43 <ItzMattu> ?
P10:25:52 <pyl> that's the gist of it
P10:25:55 <ItzMattu> Huh
P10:25:57 <ItzMattu> Not too shabby
P10:26:02 <ItzMattu> Then i could write a PHP script to parse the chat out
P10:26:10 <ItzMattu> You do it with Perl?
P10:28:40 <Testvan> plearl
P10:29:14 <ItzMattu> pyl: does &> append to the end of a file?
P10:31:42 <Syniphas> Anyone here cracked minecraft's level file structure already?
P10:32:04 <pyl> no, that would be &>>
P10:32:11 <ItzMattu> Ah okay
P10:32:13 <pyl> and no, i do it with bash
P10:32:17 <pyl> Syniphas: cracked? ;)
P10:32:17 <ItzMattu> I'd probably prefer that instead
P10:32:28 <ItzMattu> I don't want to overwrite the log everytime I restart the server
P10:32:28 <Syniphas> pyl yeah
P10:32:30 <ItzMattu> Which is often
P10:33:12 <pyl> or wait
P10:33:15 <pyl> that didn't work for me
P10:33:30 <ItzMattu> root@linux:/home/matt/minecraft_server4# java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -cp minecraft-server.jar com.mojang.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer &>> log.txt

P10:33:37 <pyl> >> log.txt 2>&1
P10:33:55 <ItzMattu> 2>&1?
P10:33:59 <ItzMattu> So cryptic XD
P10:34:14 <pyl> not really
P10:34:19 <pyl> it redirects stderr to stdout
P10:34:28 <ItzMattu> right
P10:34:33 <ItzMattu> Which is directed at log.txt

P10:35:09 <ItzMattu> I don't know bash well at all
P10:35:10 <pyl> no, that redirects stdout.
P10:35:15 <ItzMattu> I have done minimal bash scripts
P10:35:36 <Syniphas> so
P10:35:42 <Syniphas> did anyonehere do it?
P10:35:51 <ItzMattu> Why would anyone bother?
P10:35:59 <ItzMattu> What would you want the map data for?
P10:36:09 <Syniphas> External level editors/converters
P10:36:14 <Syniphas> like what giver did
P10:36:20 <Syniphas> and notch's Doom levels
P10:36:27 <ItzMattu> I have no idea what giver did
P10:36:33 <Syniphas> a level editor
P10:36:34 <ItzMattu> But if he did anything obviously he's cracked it
P10:36:38 <ItzMattu> So ask him
P10:36:42 <Syniphas> but he didn't release it
P10:36:47 <ItzMattu> Well, ask nicely?
P10:36:50 <Syniphas> He's been sleeping for the past hours now
P10:36:54 <Syniphas> I would ask
P10:40:09 <ItzMattu> pyl: >> log.txt 2&>1 creates both log.txt and a file named 1. 1 has all the stuff that intially happens when I start the server, but stops logging after that.
P10:40:19 <ItzMattu> Nevermind
P10:40:21 <ItzMattu> I am a silly goose
P10:40:24 <ItzMattu> But it is saving in 1
P10:40:26 <ItzMattu> Not log.txt
P10:40:26 <pyl> you are indeed
P10:40:45 <ItzMattu> So can i just do: >> 2&> log.txt
P10:40:46 <pyl> what kinda cooky shell do you have?
P10:40:59 <ItzMattu> I'm using ssh through putty, but my server uses bash
P10:41:06 <ItzMattu> AFAIK
P10:41:13 <ItzMattu> It's pretty much the linux standard
P10:42:19 <pyl> i'm thinking you're doing something wrong, but i don't know what
P10:43:54 <ItzMattu> From what I just read the ONLY thing I need is 2&>1 log.txt
